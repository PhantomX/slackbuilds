Subject: [PATCH] aarch64: Allow -kernel option to take a gzip-compressed
 kernel.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

On aarch64 it is the bootloader's job to uncompress the kernel.  UEFI
and u-boot bootloaders do this automatically when the kernel is
gzip-compressed.

However the qemu -kernel option does not do this.  The following
command does not work:

  qemu-system-aarch64 [...] -kernel /boot/vmlinuz

because it tries to execute the gzip-compressed data.

This commit lets gzip-compressed kernels be uncompressed
transparently.

Currently this is only done when emulating aarch64.
