# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libmtp: libmtp (A library for MTP media devices)
libmtp:
libmtp: libmtp is a library that attempts to support Microsoft's Media
libmtp: Transfer Protocol (MTP).  It was initially based the great libptp2
libmtp: library by Mariusz Woloszyn now maintained by Marcus Meissners, and
libmtp: Hubert Figuere's libgphoto2 work based on libptp2 (or is libptp2
libmtp: based on libgphoto?).  It is like a master DJ has remixed all of
libmtp: these tracks and then added a new API adapted for portable media
libmtp: players.  :-)
