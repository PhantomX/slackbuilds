# /etc/logrotate.conf
#
# logrotate is designed to ease administration of systems that generate large
# numbers of log files.  It allows automatic rotation, compression, removal, and
# mailing of log files.  Each log file may be handled daily, weekly, monthly, or
# when it grows too large.
#
# logrotate is normally run daily from root's crontab.
#
# For more details, see "man logrotate".

# rotate log files weekly:
weekly

# keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs:
rotate 4

# create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones:
create

# uncomment if you want to use the date as a suffix of the rotated file
#dateext

# uncomment this if you want your log files compressed:
#compress

# some packages install log rotation information in this directory:
include /etc/logrotate.d

# Rotate /var/log/wtmp:
/var/log/wtmp {
    monthly
    create 0664 root utmp
	minsize 1M
    rotate 1
}

# Rotate /var/log/btmp:
/var/log/btmp {
    monthly
    create 0600 root root
    rotate 1
}

# Note that /var/log/lastlog is not rotated.  This is intentional, and it should
# not be.  The lastlog file is a database, and is also a sparse file that takes
# up much less space on the drive than it appears.

# system-specific logs may be also be configured below:
