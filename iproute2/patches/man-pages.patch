+.SH NAME

+.SH SYNOPSIS

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+This manual page documents briefly the
+.B ifcfg
+command.
+.PP
+This is a simplistic script replacing one option of 
+.B ifconfig
+, namely, IP address management. It not only adds
+addresses, but also carries out Duplicate Address Detection RFC-DHCP,
+sends unsolicited ARP to update the caches of other hosts sharing
+the interface, adds some control routes and restarts Router Discovery
+when it is necessary.
+
+I strongly recommend using it 
+.RI instead
+of
+.RI ifconfig
+both on hosts and on routers.
+
+.SH IFCONFIG - COMMAND SYNTAX
+
+.SS

+.B DEVICE

+
+.SH EXAMPLE
+.nf ifcfg eth0 193.233.7.90/24
+.fi
+This function determines, whether this is router or host.
+It returns 0, if the host is apparently not router.
