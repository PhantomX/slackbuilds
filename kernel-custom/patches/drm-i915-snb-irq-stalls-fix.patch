    drm/i915: Fix gen6 (SNB) missed BLT ring interrupts.
    
    The failure appeared in dmesg as:
    
    [drm:i915_hangcheck_ring_idle] *ERROR* Hangcheck timer elapsed... blt
    ring idle [waiting on 35064155, at 35064155], missed IRQ?
    
    This works around that problem on by making the blitter command
    streamer write interrupt state to the Hardware Status Page when a
    MI_USER_INTERRUPT command is decoded, which appears to force the seqno
    out to memory before the interrupt happens.
    
    v1->v2: Moved to prior interrupt handler installation and RMW flags as
    per feedback.
    v2->v3: Removed RMW of flags (by anholt)
