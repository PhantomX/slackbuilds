snappy: snappy (Fast compression and decompression library)
snappy:
snappy: Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for
snappy: maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression
snappy: library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable
snappy: compression. For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib,
snappy: Snappy is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the
snappy: resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100%  bigger.
