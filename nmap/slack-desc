# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

nmap: nmap (Network scanner)
nmap:
nmap: Nmap ("Network Mapper") is an open source utility for network
nmap: exploration or security auditing.  It was designed to rapidly scan
nmap: large networks, although it works fine against single hosts.  Nmap
nmap: uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are
nmap: available on the network, what services (ports) they are offering,
nmap: what operating system (and OS version) they are running, what type of
nmap: packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
nmap: characteristics.  Nmap runs on most types of computers, and both
nmap: console and graphical versions are available.
