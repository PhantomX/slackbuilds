To create individual clamd-instance take the following files and
modify/copy them in the suggested way:

clamd.conf:
  * set LogFile, PidFile, LocalSocket and User to suitable values
  * place this file into /etc/clamd.d with an unique service-name;
    e.g. as /etc/clamd.d/<SERVICE>.conf

  To make logfile rotation work properly, the LogFile should be
  writable for the assigned User. Recommended way to reach this, is
  to:
  * make it owned by the User's *group*
  * assign at least 0620 (u+rw,g+w) permissions

  A suitable command might be
  | # touch <logfile>
  | # chgrp <user> <logfile>
  | # chmod 0620   <logfile>

  NEVER use 'clamav' as the user since he can modify the database.
  This is the user who is running the application; e.g. for mimedefang
  (http://www.roaringpenguin.com/mimedefang), the user might be
  'defang'.Theoretically, distinct users could be used, but it must be
  made sure that the application-user can write into the socket-file,
  and that the clamd-user can access the files asked by the
  application to be checked.


clamd.logrotate:
  * set the correct value for the logfile
  * place it into /etc/logrotate.d

clamd.sysconfig:
  * set the name of the config-file and the local socket
  * copy it to /etc/sysconfig/clamd.<SERVICE>

clamd.init:
  * set the service-name
  * place it into /etc/init.d/ with an unique name and activate it
    (e.g. with /sbin/chkconfig clamd.<SERVICE> on)

Additionally, a symlink must be set to clamd in a way like
  | # ln -s clamd /usr/sbin/clamd.<SERVICE>
and the directory for the socket file must be created (see 'LocalSocket'
in clamd.conf)
  | # mkdir -p /var/run/clamd.<SERVICE>


This directory must be writable by the 'User' chosen in the config-file.
