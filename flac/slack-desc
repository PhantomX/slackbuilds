# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

flac: flac (Free Lossless Audio Codec)
flac:
flac: FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. Grossly oversimplified,
flac: FLAC is similar to MP3, but lossless.  "Free" means that the
flac: specification of the stream format is in the public domain, and that
flac: neither the FLAC format nor any of the implemented encoding/decoding
flac: methods are covered by any patent. It also means that the sources for
flac: libFLAC and libFLAC++ are available under the LGPL and the sources for
flac: flac, metaflac, and the plugins are available under the GPL.
flac: FLAC was developed by Josh Coalson.     http://flac.sourceforge.net/
