# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libtermcap-compat32:
libtermcap-compat32: This is the GNU termcap library -- a library of C functions that
libtermcap-compat32: enable programs to send control strings to terminals in a way
libtermcap-compat32: independent of the terminal type.  Most of this package is also
libtermcap-compat32: distributed with GNU Emacs, but it is available in this separate
libtermcap-compat32: distribution to make it easier to install as -ltermcap.
