poppler-data: This package consists of encoding files for use with poppler. The
poppler-data: encoding files are optional and poppler will automatically read them
poppler-data: if they are present.  When installed, the encoding files enables
poppler-data: poppler to correctly render CJK and Cyrillic properly. While poppler
poppler-data: is licensed under the GPL, these encoding files are copyright Adobe
poppler-data: and licensed much more strictly, and thus distributed separately.
