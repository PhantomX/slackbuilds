xaw3d: xaw3d (3D version of libXaw)
xaw3d:
xaw3d: Xaw3d is a set of 3D widgets by Kaleb S. Keithley based on the Athena
xaw3d: Widget set.  The Three-D Athena may be used as a replacement for the
xaw3d: Athena (Xaw) Widget set -- you may relink almost any Athena Widget
xaw3d: based application and obtain a three dimensional appearance on some of
xaw3d: the widgets.  You can also replace your shared libXaw with libXaw3d
xaw3d: and obtain the three dimensional appearance without even relinking.
