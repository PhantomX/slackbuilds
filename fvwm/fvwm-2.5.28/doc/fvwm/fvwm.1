.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Fvwm is a window manager for X11\.  It is designed to minimize
memory consumption, provide a 3D look to window frames, and a
virtual desktop\.
.PP
Note that there are several window managers around that have
"fvwm" in their name\.  In the past, version 2\.x of fvwm was
commonly called fvwm2 to distinguish it from the former version
1\.x (fvwm or even fvwm1)\.  Since version 1\.x has been replaced by
version 2\.x a long time ago we simply call version 2\.x and all
versions to come, fvwm, throughout this document, and the
executable program is named fvwm\.  There is an fvwm offspring
called fvwm95, it is mostly a patched version of fvwm\-2\.0\.43\.  The
main goal of fvwm95 was to supply a Windows 95 like look and
feel\.  Since then, fvwm has been greatly enhanced and practically
all fvwm95 features can be achieved by fvwm\.
.PP
Fvwm provides both, a large
\fIvirtual desktop\fR
and
\fImultiple disjoint desktops\fR
which can be used separately or together\.  The virtual desktop
allows you to pretend that your video screen is really quite
large, and you can scroll around within the desktop\.  The multiple
disjoint desktops allow you to pretend that you really have
several screens to work at, but each screen is completely
unrelated to the others\.
.PP
Fvwm provides
\fIkeyboard accelerators\fR
which allow you to perform most window manager functions,
including moving and resizing windows, and operating the menus,
using keyboard shortcuts\.
.PP
Fvwm has also overcome the distinction between configuration
commands and action commands that most window managers
make\.  Configuration commands typically set fonts, colors, menu
contents, key and mouse function bindings, while action commands
do things like raise and lower windows\.  Fvwm makes no such
distinction, and allows anything to be changed at any time\.
.PP
Other noteworthy differences between fvwm and other X11 window
managers are the introduction of the \fISloppyFocus\fR and \fINeverFocus\fR
focus methods\.  Focus policy can be separately specified for
different window groups\.  Windows using \fISloppyFocus\fR acquire focus when the pointer moves into them and retain focus
until some other window acquires it\.  Such windows do not lose
focus when the pointer moves into the root window\.  The
\fINeverFocus\fR
policy is provided for use with windows into which one never types
(e\.g\. xclock, oclock, xbiff, xeyes, tuxeyes) \- for example, if a
SloppyFocus terminal window has focus, moving the pointer over a
NeverFocus
decoration window does not deprive the terminal of focus\.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
These are the command line options that are recognized by fvwm:
.PP
\fB\-i\fR | \fB\-\-clientid\fR \fIid\fR
.RS 4
This option is used when fvwm is started by a session manager\.  Should not be used by a user\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR | \fB\-\-cmd\fR \fIconfig\-command\fR
.RS 4
Causes fvwm to use
\fIconfig\-command\fR
instead of '\fBRead\fR
\fIconfig\fR' (or '\fBRead\fR
\fI\.fvwm2rc\fR') as its initialization command\.  (Note that up to 10
\fB\-f\fR
and
\fB\-c\fR
parameters can be given, and they are executed in the order specified\.)
.sp
Any module started by command line arguments is assumed to be a module that sends back config commands\.  All command line modules have to quit before fvwm proceeds on to the StartFunction and setting border decorations and styles\.  There is a potential deadlock if you start a module other than
\fBFvwmCpp\fR/\fBFvwmM4\fR/\fBFvwmPerl\fR
but there is a timeout so fvwm eventually gets going\.
.sp
As an example, starting the pager this way hangs fvwm until the timeout, but the following should work well:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
fvwm \-c "\fBAddToFunc\fR StartFunction I \fBModule\fR \fBFvwmPager\fR"
.fi
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR | \fB\-\-display\fR \fIdisplayname\fR
.RS 4
Manage the display called
\fIdisplayname\fR
instead of the name obtained from the environment variable
\fI$DISPLAY\fR\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-D\fR | \fB\-\-debug\fR
.RS 4
Puts X transactions in synchronous mode, which dramatically slows things down, but guarantees that fvwm's internal error messages are correct\.  Also causes fvwm to output debug messages while running\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR \fIconfig\-file\fR
.RS 4
Causes fvwm to read
\fIconfig\-file\fR
instead of
\fI~/\.fvwm/config\fR
as its initialization file\.  This is equivalent to \-c '\fBRead\fR
\fIconfig\-file\fR'\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR | \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
A short usage description is printed\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR | \fB\-\-replace\fR
.RS 4
Try to take over from a previously running wm\.  This does not work unless the other wm is
ICCCM2
2\.0 compliant\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-F\fR | \fB\-\-restore\fR \fIstate\-file\fR
.RS 4
This option is used when fvwm is started by a session manager\.  Should not be used by a user\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR | \fB\-\-single\-screen\fR [\fIscreen_num\fR]
.RS 4
On a multi\-screen display, run fvwm only on the screen named in the
\fI$DISPLAY\fR
environment variable or provided through the
\fB\-d\fR
option\.  The optional argument
\fIscreen_num\fR
should be positive or null and override the screen number\.  Normally, fvwm attempts to start up on all screens of a multi\-screen display\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V\fR | \fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Prints the version of fvwm to
\fIstderr\fR\.  Also prints an information about the compiled in support for readline, rplay, stroke, xpm, png, svg,
GNOME
hints,
EWMH
hints, session management, bidirectional text, multibyte characters, xinerama and Xft aa font rendering\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-C\fR | \fB\-\-visual\fR \fIvisual\-class\fR
.RS 4
Causes fvwm to use
\fIvisual\-class\fR
for the window borders and menus\.
\fIvisual\-class\fR
can be "StaticGray", "GrayScale", "StaticColor", "PseudoColor", "TrueColor" or "DirectColor"\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-I\fR | \fB\-\-visualid\fR \fIid\fR
.RS 4
Causes fvwm to use
\fIid\fR
as the visual id for the window borders and menus\.
\fIid\fR
can be specified as N for decimal or 0xN for hexadecimal\.  See man page of xdpyinfo for a list of supported visuals\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l\fR | \fB\-\-color\-limit\fR \fIlimit\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a
\fIlimit\fR
on the colors used in image, gradient and possibly simple colors used by fvwm\.  In fact, fvwm (and all the modules) uses a palette with at most
\fIlimit\fR
colors\.  This option is only useful with screens that display 256 colors (or less) with a dynamic visual (PseudoColor, GrayScale or DirectColor)\.  The default depends on your X server and how you run fvwm\.  In most case this default is reasonable\.  The
\fB\-l\fR
option should be used only if you encounter problems with colors\.  By default, fvwm tries to detect large pre\-allocated palettes\.  If such a palette is detected fvwm uses it and a priori the
\fB\-l\fR
must not be used\.  Moreover, in this case the
\fB\-A\fR
and
\fB\-S\fR
options are forced\.  Note that XFree\-4\.2 pre\-allocates 244 colors (if you use a driver with Render support) leaving only a few free colors\.  This may lead to some color problems (and nothing can be done)\.  XFree\-4\.3 or better pre\-allocate only 85 colors\.  If no pre\-allocated palette is auto detected the defaults are as follow:
.PP
Display depth 8 (256 colors)
.RS 4
.nf
.IP "" 4
PseudoColor: 68 (4x4x4 color cube + 4 grey)
GrayScale: 64 regular grey
DirectColor: 32 (3x3x3 color cube + 5 grey)
.fi
.RE
.PP
Display depth 4 (16 colors)
.RS 4
.nf
.IP "" 4
PseudoColor: 10 (2x2x2 color cube + 2 grey)
GrayScale: 8 regular grey
DirectColor: 10 (2x2x2 color cube + 2 grey)
.fi
.RE
.sp
These defaults may change before version 2\.6\.  Note that if you use a private color map (i\.e\., fvwm is started with the
\fB\-C\fR
or the
\fB\-I\fR
options), then other defaults are used\.
.sp
Now what to do if you encounter problems with colors? The first thing to do is to check if you really cannot run your X server with depth 15, 16 or better\.  Check your X server documentation\.  Note that some hardware can support two different depths on the same screen (typically depth 8 and depth 24)\.  If depth 8 is the default, you can force fvwm to use the best depth by using the
\fB\-C\fR
option with
\fITrueColor\fR
as argument\.  So now we assume that you are forced to run in depth 8 with a dynamic visual because your hardware/driver cannot do better or because you need to use an application which needs to run under this mode (e\.g\., because this application needs read\-write colors)\.  What it should be understand is that you have only 256 colors and that all the applications which use the default color map must share these colors\.  The main problem is that there are applications which use a lot or even all the colors\.  If you use such application you may have no more free colors and some applications (which used only a few colors) may fail to start or are unusable\.  There are three things that can be done (and fvwm does not really play a particular role, all applications are concerned)\.  The first is to run the applications which waste your (default) color map with a private color map\.  For example, run netscape with the \-install option, run
KDE
or
QT
applications with the \-\-cmap option, use the
\fB\-C\fR
option for fvwm\.  The disadvantage of this method is that it is visually disturbing (see the
\fBColormapFocus\fR
command for a better control of the color maps switching)\.  The second method is to limit the number of colors that the applications use\.  Again, some applications have options to specify a given color limit\.  With fvwm you may try various values, 61 (a special "visual" palette), 56 (a 4x4x3 color cube plus 6 grey), 29 (a 3x3x3 color cube plus 2 grey), 10 or 9\.  Also, you may use the
\fB\-L\fR
option\.  However, limiting the number of colors is not the definitive solution\.  The definitive solution is to try cause applications which use a lot of colors use the same colors\.  This is a difficult task as there are no formal standards for this goal\.  However, some toolkits as
QT
and
GTK
use color cubes as palettes\.  So, the idea is to configure your applications/toolkits to all use the same color cube\.  Moreover, you can use the colors in this color cube in your X resources configuration files and/or as arguments to colors options\.  Fvwm can use any color cube of the form RxGxB with 2 <= R <= 6, R = G, R\-1 =< B <= R and B >= 2\.  To get an RxGxB color cube give an argument to
\fB\-l\fR
an integer c >= R*G*B and < (R+1)*(G+1)*B if B=R and < R*G*(B+1) if B < R (and different from 61)\.  If c > R*G*B, then some grey may be added to the color cube\.  You can use the
\fBPrintInfo\fR
\fIColors\fR
[\fI1\fR]
command to get information on your fvwm colors setting\.  In particular, this command prints the palette used by fvwm in rgb format (the last integer gives the number of times fvwm has allocated the colors)\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-L\fR | \fB\-\-strict\-color\-limit\fR
.RS 4
If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual, causes fvwm to use its palette for all the colors\.  By default, the palette is used only for images and gradients\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-P\fR | \fB\-\-visual\-palette\fR
.RS 4
If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual, this option causes fvwm to use a palette designed for limiting the "visual" color distance between the points of the palette\.  Moreover, for better color sharing, if possible colors with a name in the X rgb data base are used for defining the colors (with the hope that applications and images prefer to use named colors)\.  If the
\fB\-l\fR
option is not used this palette has 61 colors\.  This palette is also automatically selected if 61 or 9 is used as argument to the
\fB\-l\fR
option\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-A\fR | \fB\-\-allocate\-palette\fR
.RS 4
If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual this option causes fvwm to allocate all the colors of its palette at start up for reserving these colors for future use\.  This option forces the
\fB\-static\-palette\fR
option\.  By default, fvwm allocates (reserves) a color in its palette only if it needs this color\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-S\fR | \fB\-\-static\-palette\fR
.RS 4
If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual this option causes fvwm to never free the colors in its palette\.  By default, when fvwm does not need a color any more it frees this color so that a new color can be used\.  This option may speed up image loading and save a few bits of memory\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-blackout\fR
.RS 4
This option is provided for backward compatibility only\.  Blacking out the screen during startup is not necessary (and doesn't work) anymore\.  This option will be removed in the future\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-debug\-stack\-ring\fR
.RS 4
Enables stack ring debugging\.  This option is only intended for internal debugging and should only be used by developers\.
.RE
.SH ANATOMY OF A WINDOW
.PP
Fvwm puts a decorative border around most windows\.  This border
consists of a bar on each side and a small L\-shaped section on
each corner\.  There is an additional top bar called the title\-bar
which is used to display the name of the window\.  In addition,
there are up to 10 title\-bar buttons\.  The top, side, and bottom
bars are collectively known as the side\-bars\.  The corner pieces
are called the frame\.
.PP
With the built\-in minimal configuration, dragging mouse button 1
in the frame or side\-bars begins a resize operation on the window\.
Dragging mouse button 2 in the frame or side\-bars begins a move
operation\.  There are raise/lower operations bound to a single
clicking on borders\.  Similarly for the window title\.
.PP
Up to ten title\-bar buttons may exist\.  Their use is completely
user definable\.  One popular configuration uses one button on the
left that is used to bring up a list of window options and two
buttons on the right used to iconify and maximize the window\.
Another popular configuration adds a close button to the right\.
The number of title\-bar buttons used depends on which ones have
mouse actions bound to them\.  See the
\fBMouse\fR
command\.
.SH THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP
.PP
Fvwm provides multiple virtual desktops for users who wish to use
them\.  The screen is a viewport onto a
\fIdesktop\fR
which may be larger than the screen\.  Several distinct desktops
can be accessed (concept: one desktop for each project, or one
desktop for each application, when view applications are
distinct)\.  Since each desktop can be larger than the physical
screen, divided into m by n
\fIpages\fR
which are each the size of the physical screen, windows which are
larger than the screen or large groups of related windows can
easily be viewed\.
.PP
The (m by n) size (i\.e\. number of pages) of the virtual desktops
can be changed any time, by using the
\fBDesktopSize\fR
command\.  All virtual desktops must be (are) the same
size\.  The total number of distinct desktops does not need to be
specified, but is limited to approximately 4 billion total\.  All
windows on a range of desktops can be viewed in the
\fBFvwmPager\fR,
a miniature view of the desktops\.  The pager is an accessory
program, called a module, which is not essential for the window
manager to operate\.  Windows may also be listed, along with their
geometries, in a window list, accessible as a pop\-up menu, or as a
separate window, called the
\fBFvwmWinList\fR
(another module)\.
.PP
Fvwm keeps the windows on the desktop in a layered stacking order;
a window in a lower layer never obscures a window in a higher
layer\.  The layer of a window can be changed by using the
\fBLayer\fR
command\.  The concept of layers is a generalization of the
\fIStaysOnTop\fR
flag of older fvwm versions\.  The
\fIStaysOnTop\fR and
\fIStaysPut\fR
\fBStyle\fR
options are now implemented by putting the windows in suitable
layers and the previously missing
\fIStaysOnBottom\fR
\fBStyle\fR
option has been added\.
.PP
\fISticky\fR
windows are windows which transcend the virtual desktop by
"Sticking to the screen's glass"\.  They always stay put on the
screen\.  This is convenient for things like clocks and xbiffs, so
you only need to run one such gadget and it always stays with you\.
Icons can also be made to stick to the glass, if desired\.
.PP
Window geometries are specified relative to the current viewport\.
That is:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
xterm \-geometry +0+0
.fi
.RE
.PP
.PP
creates a window in the upper left hand corner of the visible
portion of the screen\.  It is permissible to specify geometries
which place windows on the virtual desktop, but off the screen\.
For example, if the visible screen is 1000 by 1000 pixels, and the
desktop size is 3x3, and the current viewport is at the upper left
hand corner of the desktop, invoking:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
xterm \-geometry +1000+1000
.fi
.RE
.PP
.PP
places a window just off of the lower right hand corner of the
screen\.  It can be found by moving the mouse to the lower right
hand corner of the screen and waiting for it to scroll into view\.
A geometry specified as something like:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
xterm \-geometry \-5\-5
.fi
.RE
.PP
.PP
places the window's lower right hand corner 5 pixels from the
lower right corner of the visible portion of the screen\.  Not all
applications support window geometries with negative offsets\.
Some applications place the window's upper right hand corner 5
pixels above and to the left of the upper left hand corner of the
screen; others may do just plain bizarre things\.
.PP
There are several ways to cause a window to map onto a desktop or
page other than the currently active one\.  The geometry technique
mentioned above (specifying x,y coordinates larger than the
physical screen size), however, suffers from the limitation of
being interpreted relative to the current viewport: the window may
not consistently appear on a specific page, unless you always
invoke the application from the same page\.
.PP
A better way to place windows on a different page, screen or desk
from the currently mapped viewport is to use the
\fIStartsOnPage\fR or
\fIStartsOnScreen\fR
style specification (the successors to the older
\fIStartsOnDesk\fR
style) in your
\fIconfig\fR
file\.  The placement is consistent: it does
not depend on your current location on the virtual desktop\.
.PP
Some applications that understand standard Xt command line
arguments and X resources, like xterm and xfontsel, allow the user
to specify the start\-up desk or page on the command line:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
xterm \-xrm "*Desk:1"
.fi
.RE
.PP
.PP
starts an xterm on desk number 1;
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
xterm \-xrm "*Page:3 2 1"
.fi
.RE
.PP
.PP
starts an xterm two pages to the right and one down from the upper
left hand page of desk number 3\.  Not all applications understand
the use of these options, however\.  You could achieve the same
results with the following lines in your
\fI\.Xdefaults\fR
file:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
XTerm*Desk: 1
.fi
.RE
.PP
.PP
or
.sp
.RS 4

.SH USE ON MULTI\-SCREEN DISPLAYS
.PP
If the
\fB\-s\fR
command line argument is not given, fvwm automatically starts up
on every screen on the specified display\.  After fvwm starts each
screen is treated independently\.  Restarts of fvwm need to be
performed separately on each screen\.  The use of
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBEdgeScroll\fR 0 0
.fi
.RE
.PP
is strongly recommended for multi\-screen displays\.  You may need
to quit on each screen to quit from the X session completely\.
This is not to be confused with Xinerama support\.
.SH XINERAMA SUPPORT
.PP
Fvwm supports the Xinerama extension of newer X servers
which is similar to multi head support (multiple screens) but
allows to move windows between screens\.  If Xinerama support has
been compiled into fvwm, it is used whenever fvwm runs on an X
server that supports and uses multiple screens via Xinerama\.
Without this option, the whole desktop is treated as one big
screen\.  For example, menus might pop up right between two
screens\.  The \fIEdgeResistance\fR option
of the \fBStyle\fR command command allows for specifying
an explicit resistance value for moving windows over the screen
edge between two Xinerama screens\.  Xinerama support can be enabled
or disabled on the fly or from the configuration file with the
\fBXinerama\fR command\.  Many modules and commands work
nicely with Xinerama displays\.
.PP
Whenever a geometry in the usual X format can be supplied,
fvwm's Xinerama extension allows for specifying a screen in addition
to the geometry (or even the screen alone)\.  To do this, a '@' is
added to the end of the geometry string followed by either the
screen number or a letter\.  A number is taken as the number of the
Xinerama screen to be used (as configured in the X server)\.  The
letter can be one of 'g' for the global screen (the rectangle that
encloses all Xinerama screens), 'p' for the primary screen (see
below), 'c' for the current screen (the one that currently
contains the pointer)\.  If the X server does not support Xinerama
or only one screen is used, the screen bit is ignored\.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBStyle\fR * \fIIconBox\fR 64x300\-0\-0@p
.fi
.RE
.PP
Xinerama support can be configured to use a primary screen\.  Fvwm
can be configured to place new windows and icons on this screen\.
The primary screen is screen 0 by default but can be changed with
the
\fBXineramaPrimaryScreen\fR
command\.
.PP
Xinerama support was designed to work out of the box with the same
configuration file that would work on a single screen\.  It may
not perform very well if the involved screens use different screen
resolutions\.  In this situation, windows may get stuck in the
portion of the whole desktop that belongs to neither screen\.  When
this happens, the windows or icons can be retrieved with the
command
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBAll\fR \fBMoveToScreen\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
that can be entered in an \fBFvwmConsole\fR window or
with \fBFvwmCommand\fR\.
.PP
For multi\-screen implementations other than Xinerama, such as
Single Logical Screen, it is possible to simulate a Xinerama
configuration if the total screen seen by fvwm is made up of
equal sized monitors in a rectangular grid\.  The commands
\fBXineramaSls\fR, \fBXineramaSlsSize\fR and \fBXineramaSlsScreens\fR
are used to configure this feature\.
.SH INITIALIZATION
.PP
During initialization, fvwm searches for a configuration file
which describes key and button bindings, and many other
things\.  The format of these files is described later\.  Fvwm first
searches for configuration files using the command
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBRead\fR \fIconfig\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
This looks for file
\fIconfig\fR in \fI$FVWM_USERDIR\fR and \fI$FVWM_DATADIR\fR
directories, as described in
\fBRead\fR\.  If this fails more files are queried for backward
compatibility\.  Here is the complete list of all file locations
queried in the default installation (only the first found file
is used):
.nf
.IP "" 4
\fI$HOME\fR/\.fvwm/config
/usr/local/share/fvwm/config
.fi
.nf
.IP "" 4
\fI$HOME\fR/\.fvwm/\.fvwm2rc
\fI$HOME\fR/\.fvwm2rc
/usr/local/share/fvwm/\.fvwm2rc
/usr/local/share/fvwm/system\.fvwm2rc
/etc/system\.fvwm2rc
.fi
.PP
Please note, the last 5 locations are not guaranteed to be
supported in the future\.
.PP
If a configuration file is not found, the left mouse button, or
.SM Help
or
.SM F1
keys on the root window bring up menus and forms that can create
a starting configuration file\.
.PP
Fvwm sets two environment variables which are inherited by its
children\.  These are
\fI$DISPLAY\fR
which describes the display on which fvwm is running\.
\fI$DISPLAY\fR
may be
\fIunix:0\.0\fR
or
\fI:0\.0\fR,
which doesn't work too well when passed through ssh to another
machine, so
\fI$HOSTDISPLAY\fR
is set to a network\-ready description of the display\.
\fI$HOSTDISPLAY\fR
always uses the TCP/IP transport protocol (even for a local
connection) so
\fI$DISPLAY\fR
should be used for local connections, as it may use Unix\-domain
sockets, which are faster\.
.PP
If you want to start some applications or modules with fvwm, you
can simply put
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBExec\fR app
.fi
.RE
.PP
or
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBModule\fR FvwmXxx
.fi
.RE
.PP
into your
\fIconfig\fR,
but it is not recommended; do this only if you know what you are
doing\.  It is usually important to start applications or modules
after the entire config is read, because it contains styles or
module configurations which can affect window appearance and
functionality\.
.PP
The standard way to start applications or modules on fvwm's start
up is to add them to an initialization function (usually
\fBStartFunction\fR or \fBInitFunction\fR)\.
This way they are only started after fvwm finishes to read and
execute
\fIconfig\fR
file\.
.PP
Fvwm has three special functions for initialization:
\fBStartFunction\fR,
which is executed on startups and restarts;
\fBInitFunction\fR and \fBRestartFunction\fR,
which are executed during initialization and restarts
(respectively) just after StartFunction\.  These functions may be
customized in a user's
\fIconfig\fR
file using the
\fBAddToFunc\fR
command (described later) to start up modules, xterms, or whatever
you'd like to have started by fvwm\.
.PP
Fvwm has also a special exit function:
\fBExitFunction\fR,
executed when exiting or restarting before actually quitting\.
It could be used to explicitly kill modules, etc\.
.PP
If fvwm is run under a session manager, functions
\fBSessionInitFunction\fR and \fBSessionRestartFunction\fR
are executed instead of InitFunction and RestartFunction\.
This helps to define the user's
\fIconfig\fR
file to be good for both running under a session manager and
without it\.  Generally it is a bad idea to start xterms or other
applications in "Session*" functions\.  Also someone can decide to
start different modules while running under a session manager or
not\.  For the similar purposes
\fBSessionExitFunction\fR
is used instead of ExitFunction\.

.SH COMPILATION OPTIONS

Fvwm has a number of compile\-time options\.  If you have trouble

was included at compile time\.  Optional features are described in
the \fIconfig\.h\fR file that is generated
during compilation\.
.SH ICONS AND IMAGES
.PP
Fvwm can load \fB\.xbm,\fR \fB\.xpm,\fR
\fB\.png\fR and
\fB\.svg\fR images\.  \fBXBM\fR
images are monochrome\.  Fvwm can always display
\fBXBM\fR files\.  \fBXPM\fR

SVG is a vector graphics image format\.
Compile\-time options determine whether fvwm can display
\fBXPM\fR, \fBPNG\fR or
\fBSVG\fR
icons and images\.  See the \fIINSTALL\.fvwm\fR
file for more information\.
.PP
The related \fBSHAPE\fR
compile\-time option can make fvwm display spiffy shaped icons\.
.SS SVG rendering options

SVG images are generated from (XML) text files\.  A really simple SVG file

.sp

.RE
.PP
By default, SVG images are rendered as the image creator intended
them to\.  But since SVG is a vector graphics format, the images can
be rendered at any choosen size and rotation, e\.g\. making it possible
to use the same icon file rendered at diffrent sizes for the
\fIIcon\fR and \fIMiniIcon\fR
styles\.
.PP
The rendering options are specified as a string appended to the SVG
filename as follows:
.HP 1
\fI\fIimage\.svg\fR\fR:[!] [(1)\ \fIsize\fR] [(2)\ \fIposition\fR]\ [(3)\ \fIrotation\fR]\ [(4)\ \fIscale\fR] ...

.SH MODULES
.PP
A module is a separate program which runs as a separate Unix
process but transmits commands to fvwm to execute\.  Users can
write their own modules to do any weird or bizarre manipulations
without bloating or affecting the integrity of fvwm itself\.
.PP
Modules must be spawned by fvwm so that it can set up two pipes
for fvwm and the module to communicate with\.  The pipes are
already open for the module when it starts and the file
descriptors for the pipes are provided as command line arguments\.
.PP
Modules can be spawned by fvwm at any time during the X session by
use of the
\fBModule\fR
command\.  Modules can exist for the duration of the X
session, or can perform a single task and exit\.  If the module is
still active when fvwm is told to quit, then fvwm closes the
communication pipes and waits to receive a SIGCHLD from the
module, indicating that it has detected the pipe closure and has
exited\.  If modules fail to detect the pipe closure fvwm exits
after approximately 30 seconds anyway\.  The number of
simultaneously executing modules is limited by the operating
system's maximum number of simultaneously open files, usually
between 60 and 256\.
.PP
Modules simply transmit commands to the fvwm command
engine\.  Commands are formatted just as in the case of a
mouse binding in the
\fIconfig\fR
setup file\.  Certain auxiliary information is also transmitted, as
in the sample module
\fBFvwmButtons\fR\.
.PP
Please refer to the
\fBModule Commands\fR
section for details\.
.SH ICCCM COMPLIANCE
.PP
Fvwm attempts to be
ICCCM
2\.0 compliant\.  Check
\fIhttp://tronche\.com/gui/x/icccm/\fR for more info\.  In addition,
ICCCM
states that it should be possible for applications to receive any
keystroke, which is not consistent with the keyboard shortcut
approach used in fvwm and most other window managers\.  In
particular you cannot have the same keyboard shortcuts working
with your fvwm and another fvwm running within Xnest (a nested X
server running in a window)\.  The same problem exists with mouse
bindings\.
.PP
The
ICCCM
states that windows possessing the property
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
WM_HINTS(WM_HINTS):
    Client accepts input or input focus: False
.fi
.RE
.PP
should not be given the keyboard input focus by the window
manager\.  These windows can take the input focus by themselves,
however\.  A number of applications set this property, and yet
expect the window manager to give them the keyboard focus anyway,
so fvwm provides a window style,
\fILenience\fR, 
which allows fvwm to overlook this
ICCCM
rule\.  Even with this window style it is not guaranteed that the
application accepts focus\.
.PP
The differences between
ICCCM
1\.1 and 2\.0 include the ability to take over from a running
ICCCM
2\.0 compliant window manager; thus
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
fvwm; vi ~/\.fvwm/config; fvwm \-replace
.fi
.RE
.PP
.PP
resembles the
\fBRestart\fR
command\.  It is not exactly the same, since killing the previously
running wm may terminate your X session, if the wm was started as
the last client in your
\fI\.Xclients\fR or \fI\.Xsession\fR
file\.
.PP
Further additions are support for client\-side colormap
installation (see the
ICCCM
for details) and the urgency hint\.  Clients can set this hint in
the WM_HINTS property of their window and expect the window manager
to attract the user's attention to the window\.  Fvwm has two re\-definable
functions for this purpose, "UrgencyFunc" and "UrgencyDoneFunc", which
are executed when the flag is set/cleared\.  Their default definitions are:
.sp
.RS 4

work with
KDE
version >= 2,
GNOME
version 2 and other applications which respect this specification
(any application based on
\fIGTK+\fR
version 2)\.  Applications which respect this specification are
called ewmh compliant applications\.

This support is configurable with styles and commands\.
These styles and commands have
EWMH

.PP
When a compliant taskbar asks fvwm to activate a window (typically
when you click on a button which represents a window in such a
taskbar), then fvwm calls the complex function
\fBEWMHActivateWindowFunc\fR
which by default is Iconify Off, Focus and Raise\.  You can redefine
this function\.  For example:
.sp

.fi
.RE
.PP
additionally warps the pointer to the center of the window\.
.PP
The
EWMH
specification introduces the notion of Working Area\.  Without ewmh
support the Working Area is the full visible screen (or all your
screens if you have a multi head setup and you use Xinerama)\.
However, compliant applications (such as a panel) can ask to
reserve space at the edge of the screen\.  If this is the case, the
Working Area is your full visible screen minus these reserved
spaces\.  If a panel can be hidden by clicking on a button the
Working Area does not change (as you can unhide the panel at any
time), but the Dynamic Working Area is updated: the space reserved
by the panel is removed (and added again if you pop up the
panel)\.  The Dynamic Working Area may be used when fvwm places or
maximizes a window\.  To know if an application reserves space you
can type "xprop | grep _NET_WM_STRUT" in a terminal and select the
application\.  If four numbers appear then these numbers define the
reserved space as explained in the
\fBEwmhBaseStruts\fR
command\.

Most (perhaps all) Open Look applications have a strange notion of

The configuration file is used to describe mouse and button

By using the
\fBRead\fR
command, it is easy to read in new configuration files as you go\.
.PP
Lines beginning with '#' are ignored by fvwm\.  Lines starting with '*'
are expected to contain module configuration commands (rather
than configuration commands for fvwm itself)\.  Like in shell
scripts embedded newlines in a configuration file line can be
quoted by preceding them with a backslash\.  All lines linked in
this fashion are treated as a single line\.  The newline itself is
ignored\.
.PP
Fvwm makes no distinction between configuration commands and
action commands, so anything mentioned in the fvwm commands
section can be placed on a line by itself for fvwm to execute as
it reads the configuration file, or it can be placed as an
executable command in a menu or bound to a mouse button or a
keyboard key\.  It is left as an exercise for the user to decide
which function make sense for initialization and which ones make
sense for run\-time\.

That is, you can use an X Logical Font Description (XLFD for

loaded in priority order\.  For example with
.sp
.RS 4

.fi
.RE
.PP
Each simple font name is tried until a matching font with the
locale charset is found and if this fails each simple font name is
tried without constraint on the charset\.
.PP
More details on the XLFD can be found in the X manual page, the X
Logical Font Description Conventions document (called xlfd) and
the XLoadFont and XCreateFontSet manual pages\.  Some useful font
utilities are: xlsfonts, xfontsel, xfd and xset\.
.PP
If you have Xft support you can specify an Xft font name
(description) of a true type (or Type1) font prefixed by "xft:",
for example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
"xft:Luxi Mono"
"xft:Luxi Mono:Medium:Roman:size=14:encoding=iso8859\-1"
.fi
.RE
.PP
The "first" font which matches the description is loaded\.  This
first font depends on the XftConfig configuration file with Xft1
and on the /etc/fonts/fonts\.conf file with Xft2\.
One may read the Xft manual page and the fontconfig man page with
Xft2\.  The first string which follows "xft:" is always considered
as the family\.  With the second example Luxi Mono is the Family
(Other XFree TTF families: "Luxi Serif", "Luxi Sans"), Medium is
the Weight (other possible weights: Light, DemiBold, Bold, Black),
Roman is the slant or the style (other possibilities: Regular,
Oblique, Italic) size specifies the point size (for a pixel size
use pixelsize=), encoding allows for enforce a charset (iso8859\-1
or iso10646\-1 only; if no encoding is given the locale charset is
assumed)\.
An important parameter is "minspace=bool" where bool is True or
False\.  If bool is False (the default?) Xft gives a greater font
height to fvwm than if bool is True\.  This may modify text
placement, icon and window title height, line spacing in menus and
\fBFvwmIdent\fR, button height in some fvwm modules \.\.\.etc\.  With a LCD
monitor you may try to add "rgba=mode" where mode is either rgb,
bgr, vrgb or vbgr to enable subpixel rendering\.  The best mode
depends on the way your LCD cells are arranged\.  You can pass other
specifications in between ":", as "foundry=foundry_name",
"spacing=type" where type can be monospace, proportional or
charcell, "charwidth=integer", "charheight=integer" or
"antialias=bool" where bool is True or False\.  It seems that these
parameters are not always taken in account\.
.PP
To determine which Xft fonts are really loaded you can export
XFT_DEBUG=1 before starting fvwm and take a look to the error
log\.  With Xft2 you may use fc\-list to list the available
fonts\.  Anyway, Xft support is experimental (from the X and the
fvwm point of view) and the quality of the rendering depends on
number of parameters (the XFree and the freetype versions and your
video card(s))\.
.PP
After an Xft font name you can add after a ";" an XLFD
font name (simple or extended) as:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
xft:Verdana:pixelsize=14;\-adobe\-courier\-bold\-r\-normal\-\-14\-*
.fi
.RE
.PP
then, if either loading the Xft font fails or fvwm has no Xft
support, fvwm loads the font
"\-adobe\-courier\-bold\-r\-normal\-\-14\-*"\.  This allows for writing
portable configuration files\.
.SS Font and string encoding
.PP
Once a font is loaded, fvwm finds its encoding (or charset) using
its name (the last two fields of the name)\.  fvwm assumes that the
strings which are displayed with this font use this encoding (an
exception is that if an iso10646\-1 font is loaded, then UTF\-8 is
assumed for string encoding)\.
In a normal situation,
(i) a font is loaded by giving a font name without specifying the
encoding,
(ii) the encoding of the loaded font is the locale encoding, and
then
(iii) the strings in the fvwm configuration files should use the
locale encoding as well as the window and icon name\.  With Xft the
situation is bit different as Xft supports only iso10646\-1 and
iso8859\-1\.  If you do not specify one of these encodings in the Xft
font name, then fvwm does strings conversion using (iii)\.  Note
that with multibyte fonts (and in particular with "CJK" fonts) for
good text rendering, the locale encoding should be the charset of
the font\.
.PP
To override the previous rules, it is possible to specify the
string encoding in the beginning of a font description as follow:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
StringEncoding=\fIenc\fR:_full_font_name_
.fi
.RE
.PP
where
\fIenc\fR
is an encoding supported by fvwm (usually font name charset plus some
unicode encodings: UTF\-8, USC\-2, USC\-4 and UTF\-16)\.
.PP
For example, you may use an iso8859\-1 locale charset and have an
\fBFvwmForm\fR in Russian using koi8\-r encoding\.  In this case, you just
have to ask \fBFvwmForm\fR to load a koi8\-r font by specifying the
encoding in the font name\.  With a multibyte language, (as
multibyte font works well only if the locale encoding is the
charset of the font), you should use an iso10646\-1 font:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
StringEncoding=jisx0208\.1983\-0:\-*\-fixed\-medium\-r\-*\-ja\-*\-iso10646\-1
.fi
.RE
.PP
or
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
"StringEncoding=jisx0208\.1983\-0:xft:Bitstream Cyberbit"
.fi
.RE
.PP
if your
\fBFvwmForm\fR
configuration uses jisx0208\.1983\-0 encoding\.  Another possibility
is to use UTF\-8 encoding for your \fBFvwmForm\fR configuration and use
an iso10646\-1 font:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\-*\-fixed\-medium\-r\-*\-ja\-*\-iso10646\-1
.fi
.RE
.PP
or
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
"StringEncoding=UTF\-8:xft:Bitstream Cyberbit"
.fi
.RE
.PP
or equivalently
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
"xft:Bitstream Cyberbit:encoding=iso10646\-1"
.fi
.RE
.PP
In general iso10646\-1 fonts together with UTF\-8 string encoding
allows the display of any characters in a given menu, \fBFvwmForm\fR
etc\.
.PP
More and more, unicode is used and text files use UTF\-8
encoding\.  However, in practice the characters used range over your
locale charset (this is the case when you generate a menu with
fvwm\-menu\-desktop with recent versions of KDE and
GNOME)\.  For
saving memory (an iso10646\-1 font may have a very large number of
characters) or because you have a pretty font without an
iso10646\-1 charset, you can specify the string encoding to be
UTF\-8 and use a font in the locale charset:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
StringEncoding=UTF\-8:\-*\-pretty_font\-*\-12\-*
.fi
.RE
.PP
In most cases, fvwm correctly determines the encoding of the
font\.  However, some fonts do not end with valid encoding
names\.  When the font name isn't normal, for example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\-misc\-fixed\-*\-\-20\-*\-my_utf8\-36
.fi
.RE
.PP
you need to add the encoding after the font name using a slash as
a delimiter\.  For example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBMenuStyle\fR * \fIFont\fR \-misc\-fixed\-*\-\-20\-*\-my_utf8\-36/iso10646\-1
.fi
.RE
.PP
If fvwm finds an encoding, fvwm uses the iconv system functions to
do conversion between encodings\.  Unfortunately, there are no
standards\.  For conversion between iso8859\-1 and UTF\-8: a GNU
system uses "ISO\-8859\-1" and other systems use "iso881" to define
the converters (these two names are supported by fvwm)\.  Moreover,
in some cases it may be necessary to use machine specific
converters\.  So, if you experience problems you can try to get
information on your iconv implementation ("man iconv" may help)
and put the name which defines the converter between the font
encoding and UTF\-8 at the end of the font name after the encoding
hint and a / (another possible solution is to use GNU
libiconv)\.  For example use:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBStyle\fR * \fIFont\fR \-misc\-fixed\-*\-\-14\-*\-iso8859\-1/*/latin1
.fi
.RE
.PP
to use latin1 for defining the converter for the iso8859\-1 encoding\.
The "*" in between the "/" says to fvwm to determine the
encoding from the end of the font name\.  Use:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBStyle\fR * \fIFont\fR \e
	\-misc\-fixed\-*\-\-14\-*\-local8859\-6/iso8859\-6/local_iso8859_6_iconv
.fi
.RE
.PP
to force fvwm to use the font with iso8859\-6 as the encoding
(this is useful for bi\-directionality)
and to use local_iso8859_6_iconv for defining the converters\.
.SS Font Shadow Effects
.PP
Fonts can be given 3d effects\.  At the beginning of the font name
(or just after a possible StringEncoding specification) add
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Shadow=\fIsize\fR [\fIoffset\fR] [\fIdirections]\fR]:
.fi
.RE
.PP
\fIsize\fR
is a positive integer which specifies the number of pixels of shadow\.
\fIoffset\fR
is an optional positive integer which defines the number of pixels
to offset the shadow from the edge of the character\.  The default
offset is zero\.
\fIdirections\fR
is an optional set of directions the shadow emanates from the
character\.  The
\fIdirections\fR
are a space separated list of fvwm directions:
.PP
\fIN\fR, \fINorth\fR, \fITop\fR, \fIt\fR, \fIUp\fR, \fIu\fR, \fI\-\fR
.PP
\fIE\fR, \fIEast\fR, \fIRight\fR, \fIr\fR, \fIRight\fR, \fIr\fR, \fI]\fR

.PP
\fIC\fR, \fICenter\fR, \fICentre\fR, \fI\.\fR
.PP
A shadow is displayed in each given direction\.
\fIAll\fR
is equivalent to all the directions\.  The default
\fIdirection\fR
is
\fIBottomRight\fR\.
With the
\fICenter\fR
direction, the shadow surrounds the whole string\.  Since this is a
super set of all other directions, it is a waste of time to
specify this along with any other directions\.
.PP
The shadow effect only works with colorsets\.  The color of the
shadow is defined by using the
\fIfgsh\fR
option of the
\fBColorset\fR
command\.  Please refer to the
\fBColorsets\fR
section for details about colorsets\.
.PP
Note: It can be difficult to find the font,
\fIfg\fR, \fIfgsh\fR and \fIbg\fR
colors to make this effect look good, but it can look quite good\.
.SH BI\-DIRECTIONAL TEXT
.PP
Arabic and Hebrew text require bi\-directional text support to be
displayed correctly, this means that logical strings should be
converted before their visual presentation, so left\-to\-right and
right\-to\-left sub\-strings are determined and reshuffled\.
In fvwm this is done automatically in window titles, menus,
module labels and other places if the fonts used for displaying the
text are of one of the charsets that require
\fIbidi\fR
(bi\-directional) support\.  For example, this includes iso8859\-6,
iso8859\-8 and iso10646\-1 (unicode), but not other iso8859\-* fonts\.
.PP
This bi\-directional text support is done using the
\fIfribidi\fR
library compile time option, see
\fIINSTALL\.fvwm\fR\.
.SH KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
.PP
Almost all window manager operations can be performed from the
keyboard so mouse\-less operation should be possible\.  In addition
to scrolling around the virtual desktop by binding the
\fBScroll\fR
command to appropriate keys,
\fBPopup\fR,
\fBMove\fR,
\fBResize\fR, 
and any other command can be bound to keys\.  Once a command
is started the pointer is moved by using the up, down,
left, and right arrows, and the action is terminated by pressing
return\.  Holding down the
.SM Shift
key causes the pointer movement to go in larger steps and holding
down the
.SM control
key causes the pointer movement to go in smaller steps\.  Standard
emacs and vi cursor movement controls (
.SM n
,
.SM p
,
.SM f
,
.SM b
,
and
.SM j
,
.SM k
,
.SM h
,
.SM l
) can be used instead of the arrow keys\.
.SH SESSION MANAGEMENT
.PP
Fvwm supports session management according to the X Session
Management Protocol\.  It saves and restores window position, size,
stacking order, desk, stickiness, shadiness, maximizedness,
iconifiedness for all windows\.  Furthermore, some global state is
saved\.
.PP
Fvwm doesn't save any information regarding styles, decors,
functions or menus\.  If you change any of these resources during a
session (e\.g\. by issuing
\fBStyle\fR
commands or by using various modules), these changes are lost
after saving and restarting the session\.  To become permanent,
such changes have to be added to the configuration file\.
.PP
Note further that the current implementation has the following
anomaly when used on a multi\-screen display: Starting fvwm for the
first time, fvwm manages all screens by forking a copy of itself
for each screen\.  Every copy knows its parent and issuing a
\fBQuit\fR
command to any instance of fvwm kills the master and thus all
copies of fvwm\.  When you save and restart the session, the
session manager brings up a copy of fvwm on each screen, but this
time they are started as individual instances managing one screen
only\.  Thus a
\fBQuit\fR
kills only the copy it was sent to\.  This is probably not a very
serious problem, since with session management, you are supposed
to quit a session through the session manager anyway\.  If it is
really needed,
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBExec\fR exec killall fvwm
.fi
.RE
.PP
still kills all copies of fvwm\.  Your system must have the
\fBkillall\fR
command though\.
.SH BOOLEAN ARGUMENTS
.PP
A number of commands take one or several boolean arguments\.  These take a few equivalent inputs: "yes", "on", "true", "t" and "y" all evaluate to true while "no", "off", "false", "f" and "n" evaluate to false\.  Some commands allow "toggle" too which means that the feature is disabled if it is currently enabled and vice versa\.
.SH BUILTIN KEY AND MOUSE BINDINGS
.PP
The following commands are built\-in to fvwm:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBKey\fR Help R A \fBPopup\fR MenuFvwmRoot
\fBKey\fR F1 R A \fBPopup\fR MenuFvwmRoot
\fBKey\fR Tab A M \fBWindowList\fR Root c c NoDeskSort

\fBAddToFunc\fR FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX
+ I \fBRaise\fR
+ M $0
+ D \fBLower\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
The
.SM Help
and
.SM F1
keys invoke a built\-in menu that fvwm creates\.  This is primarily
for new users that have not created their own configuration
file\.  Either key on the root (background) window pops up an menu
to help you get started\.
.PP
The
.SM Tab
key pressed anywhere with the
.SM Meta
key (same as the
.SM Alt
key on PC keyboards) held down pop\-ups a window list\.
.PP
Mouse button 1 on the title\-bar or side frame can move, raise or
lower a window\.
.PP
Mouse button 1 on the window corners can resize, raise or lower a

You can override or remove these bindings\.  To remove the window
list binding, use this:
.sp

.RE
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
.SS Module and Function Commands
.PP

it checks to see if the
specified command should have been
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBFunction\fR (rest of command)
.fi
.RE
.PP
or
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBModule\fR (rest of command)
.fi
.RE
.PP
This allows complex functions or modules to be invoked in a manner
which is fairly transparent to the configuration file\.
.PP
Example: the
\fIconfig\fR
file contains the line
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
HelpMe
.fi
.RE
.PP
Fvwm looks for an fvwm command called "HelpMe", and fails\.
Next it looks for a user\-defined complex function called "HelpMe"\.
If no such function exists, fvwm tries to execute a
module called "HelpMe"\.
.SS Delayed Execution of Commands
.PP
Note: There are many commands that affect look and feel of
specific, some or all windows, like
\fBStyle\fR, \fBMouse\fR, \fBColorset\fR, \fBTitleStyle\fR
and many others\.  For performance reasons such changes are
not applied immediately but only when fvwm is idle, i\.e\. no user
interaction or module input is pending\.  Specifically, new
\fBStyle\fR
options that are set in a function are not applied until after the
function has completed\.  This can sometimes lead to unwanted
effects\.
.PP
To force that all pending changes are applied immediately, use the
\fBUpdateStyles\fR, \fBRefresh\fR or \fBRefreshWindow\fR
commands\.
.SH QUOTING
.PP
Quotes are required only when needed to make fvwm consider two or
more words to be a single argument\.  Unnecessary quoting is
allowed\.  If you want a quote character in your text, you must
escape it by using the backslash character\.  For example, if you
have a pop\-up menu called "Window\-Ops", then you do not need
quotes:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBPopup\fR Window\-Ops
.fi
.RE
.PP
but if you replace the dash with a space, then you need
quotes:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBPopup\fR "Window Ops"
.fi
.RE
.PP
The supported quoting characters are double quotes, single quotes
and reverse single quotes\.  All three kinds of quotes are treated
in the same way\.  Single characters can be quoted with a preceding
backslash\.  Quoting single characters works even inside other
kinds of quotes\.
.SH COMMAND EXPANSION
.PP
Whenever an fvwm command line is executed, fvwm performs parameter
expansion\.  A parameter is a '$' followed by a word enclosed in
brackets ($[\.\.\.]) or a single special character\.  If fvwm
encounters an unquoted parameter on the command line it expands it
to a string indicated by the parameter name\.  Unknown parameters
are left untouched\.  Parameter expansion is performed before
quoting\.  To get a literal '$' use "$$"\.
.PP
If a command is prefixed with a '\-' parameter expansion isn't
performed\.  This applies to the command immediately following the '\-',
in which the expansion normally would have taken place\.  When uesed
together with other prefix commands it must be added before the other
prefix\.
.PP
Example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBPick\fR \-\fBExec\fR exec xmessage '$[w\.name]'
.fi
.RE
.PP
opens an xmessage dialog with "$[w\.name]" unexpanded\.
.PP
The longer variables may contain additional variables inside the
name, which are expanded before the outer variable\.
.PP
In earlier versions of fvwm, some single letter variables were
supported\.  It is deprecated now, since they cause a number of
problems\.  You should use the longer substitutes instead\.
.PP
Example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
# Print the current desk number, horizontal page number
# and the window's class (unexpanded here, no window)\.
\fBEcho\fR $[desk\.n] $[page\.nx] $[w\.class]
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note: If the command is called outside a window context, it
prints "$[w\.class]" instead of the class name\.  It is usually not
enough to have the pointer over a window to have a context window\.
To force using the window with the focus, the
\fBCurrent\fR
command can be used:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBCurrent\fR \fBEcho\fR $[desk\.n] $[page\.nx] $[w\.class]
.fi

.sp
Note, the first 5 variables may include any kind of characters, so these variables are quoted\.  It means that the value is surrounded by single quote characters and any contained single quote is prefixed with a backslash\.  This guarantees that commands like:

.SH SCRIPTING & COMPLEX FUNCTIONS
.PP
To achieve the more complex effects, fvwm has a number of
commands that improve its scripting abilities\.  Scripts can be
read from a file with
\fBRead\fR,
from the output of a command with
\fBPipeRead\fR
or written as a complex function with the
\fBAddToFunc\fR
command\.  For the curious, section 7 of the fvwm FAQ shows some
real life applications of scripting\.  Please refer to the sections
\fBUser Functions and Shell Commands\fR
and
\fBConditional Commands\fR
for details\.  A word of warning: during execution of complex
functions, fvwm needs to take all input from the mouse pointer
(the pointer is "grabbed" in the slang of X)\.  No other programs
can receive any input from the pointer while a function is run\.
This can confuse some programs\.  For example, the xwd program
refuses to make screen shots when run from a complex function\.  To
achieve the same functionality you can use the
\fBRead\fR
or
\fBPipeRead\fR
command instead\.

.SS Menus
.PP
Before a menu can be opened, it has to be populated with menu
items using the
\fBAddToMenu\fR
command and bound to a key or mouse button with the
\fBKey\fR,
\fBPointerKey\fR or
\fBMouse\fR
command (there are many other ways to invoke a menu too)\.  This is
usually done in the configuration file\.
.PP
Fvwm menus are extremely configurable in look and feel\.  Even the
slightest nuances can be changed to the user's liking, including
the menu item fonts, the background, delays before popping up sub
menus, generating menus dynamically and many other features\.
Please refer to the
\fBMenuStyle\fR
command to learn more\.
.TP
.B Types of Menus
.RS
.\".PP
In fvwm there are four slightly different types of menus:
.PP
\fBPopup\fR menus
can appear everywhere on the screen on their own or attached to a
part of a window\.  The
\fBPopup\fR
command opens popup menus\.  If the popup menu was invoked with a
mouse button held down, it is closed when the button is released\.
The item under the pointer is then activated and the associated
action is executed\.
.PP
\fBMenu\fR
is a very similar command, but the menus it opens are slightly less
transient\.  When invoked by clicking a mouse button, it stays open
and can be navigated with no button held\.  But if it is invoked by
a button press followed by mouse motion, it behaves exactly like a
popup menu\.
.PP
\fITear off menus\fR or \fIPin up menus\fR
are menus from either of the above two commands that have been
"torn off" their original context and pinned on the desktop like a
normal window\.  They are created from other menus by certain key
presses or mouse sequences or with the
\fBTearMenuOff\fR
command from inside a menu\.
.PP
\fISub menus\fR
are menus inside menus\.  When a menu item that has the
\fBPopup\fR
command as its action is selected, the named menu is opened as an
inferior menu to the parent\.  Any type of menu can have sub menus\.
.RE
.TP
.B Menu Anatomy
.RS
.\".PP
Menus consist of any number of titles which are inactive menu
items that usually appear at the top of the menu, normal items
triggering various actions when selected, separator lines between
the items, tear off bars (a horizontal broken line) that tear off
the menu when selected, and sub menu items indicated with a
triangle pointing left or right, depending on the direction in
which the sub menu appears\.  All the above menu items are
optional\.
.PP
Additionally, if the menu is too long to fit on the screen, the
excess menu items are put in a continuation menu and a sub menu
with the string "More\.\.\." is placed at the bottom of the menu\.  The
"More\.\.\." string honors the locale settings\.
.PP
Finally, there may be a picture running up either side of the menu
(a "side bar")\.
.RE
.TP
.B Menu Navigation
.RS
.\".PP
Menus can be navigated either with the keyboard or with the
mouse\.  Many people prefer to use the mouse, but it can be rather
tedious\.  Once you get the hang of it, keyboard navigation can be
much faster\.  While fvwm displays a menu, it can do nothing else\.
For example, new windows do not appear before the menu is closed\.
However, this is not exactly true for tear off menus\.  See the
\fBTear Off Menus\fR
section for details\.
.RE
.TP
.B Mouse Navigation
.RS
.\".PP
Moving the pointer over a menu selects the item below it\.
Normally this is indicated by a 3d border around the item, but not
all parts of a menu can be selected\.  Pressing any mouse button
while a menu is open by default activates the item below it\.  Items of a
popup menu are also activated by releasing a held mouse button\.
In case of an item that hides a sub menu, the sub menu is
displayed if the pointer hovers over the item long enough or moves
close to the triangle indicating the sub menu\.  This behaviour can
be tuned with menu styles\.
.PP
Scrolling a mouse wheel over a menu either wraps the pointer along the
menu (default), scrolls the menu under the pointer or act as if the
menu was clicked depending on the
\fIMouseWheel\fR menu style\.
.PP
Clicking on a selected item activates it \- what happens exactly
depends on the type of the item\.
.PP
Clicking on a title, a separator, the side bar, or outside the
menu closes the menu (exception: tear off menus can not be closed
this way)\.  Pressing mouse button 2 over a menu title or
activating a tear off bar creates a tear off menu from the current
menu\.  Clicking on a normal menu item invokes the command that is
bound to it, and clicking on a sub menu item either closes all
open menus and replaces them with the sub menu or posts the menu
(default)\.
.PP
Posting menus is meant to ease mouse navigation\.  Once a sub menu
is posted, only items from that sub menu can be selected\.  This
can be very useful to navigate the menu if the pointer tends to
stray off the menu\.  To unpost the menu and revert back to normal
operation, either click on the same sub menu item or press any
key\.
.RE
.TP
.B Keyboard Navigation
.RS
.\".PP
Just like with mouse navigation, the item below the pointer is
selected\.  This is achieved by warping the pointer to the menu
items when necessary\.  While a menu is open, all key presses are
intercepted by the menu\.  No other application can get keyboard
input (although this is not the case for tear off menus)\.
.PP
Items can be selected directly by pressing a hotkey that can be
configured individually for each menu item\.  The hotkey is
indicated by underlining it in the menu item label\.  With the
\fIAutomaticHotkeys\fR
menu style fvwm automatically assigns hotkeys to all menu items\.
.PP
The most basic keys to navigate through menus are the cursor keys
(move up or down one item, enter or leave a sub menu),
.SM Space
(activate item) and
.SM Escape
(close menu)\.  Numerous other keys can be used to navigate through
menus by default:
.PP
\fIEnter\fR,
\fIReturn\fR,
\fISpace\fR

.PP
\fIEscape\fR,

The keys and mouse buttons used to navigate the menu can be configured
using the
\fBKey\fR

\fBMouse\fR
commands with the special context 'M', possible combined with 'T' for
the menu title, 'I' for other menu items, 'S' for any border or
sidepic, '[' for left border including a left sidepic, ']' for right
border including a right sidepic, '\-' for top border, '_' for bottom
border\.  The menu context uses its own set of actions that can be bound
to keys and mouse buttons\.  These are
\fIMenuClose\fR,
\fIMenuCloseAndExec\fR,
\fIMenuEnterContinuation\fR,
\fIMenuEnterSubmenu\fR,
\fIMenuLeaveSubmenu\fR,
\fIMenuMoveCursor\fR,

the second argument specifies an absolute item in the menu to move
the pointer to\.  Negative items are counted from the end of the menu\.
If the first argument is non\-zero, the second argument must be omitted,
and the first argument specifies a relative change in the selected item\.
The positions may be suffixed with a 's' to indicate that the items should
refer only to the first items after separators\.

A tear off menu is any menu that has been "torn off" the window it
was attached to and pinned to the root window\.  There are three
ways to tear off a menu: click on the menu title with mouse
button 2, press
.SM Backspace
in the menu or activate its tear off bar (a horizontal bar with a
broken line)\.  Tear off bars must be added to the menu as any
other item by assigning them the command
\fBTearMenuOff\fR\.
.PP
The builtin tear off actions can be overridden by undefining the
builtin menu actions bound to tear off\.  To remove the builtin mouse
button 2 binding, use:

A tear off menu is a cross breeding between a window and a menu\.
The menu is swallowed by a window and its title is stripped off
and displayed in the window title\.  The main advantage is that the
menu becomes permanent \- activating an item does not close the
menu\.  Therefore, it can be used multiple times without reopening
it\.  To destroy such a menu, close its window or press the
.SM Escape
key\.
.PP
Tear off menus behave somewhat differently than normal menus and
windows\.  They do not take the keyboard focus, but while the
pointer is over one of them, all key presses are sent to the
menu\.  Other fvwm key bindings are disabled as long as the pointer
is inside the tear off menu or one of its sub menus\.  When the
pointer leaves this area, all sub menus are closed immediately\.
Note that the window containing a tear off menu is never hilighted
as if it had the focus\.
.PP
A tear off menu is an independent copy of the menu it originated
from\.  As such, it is not affected by adding items to that menu or
changing its menu style\.
.PP
To create a tear off menu without opening the normal menu first,
the option
\fITearOffImmediately\fR
can be added to the
\fBMenu\fR or \fBPopup\fR
command\.

There is no end\-of\-menu symbol\.  Menus do not have to be defined
in a contiguous region of the
\fIconfig\fR
file\.  The quoted (or first word)
portion in the above examples is the menu label,
which appears in the menu when the user pops it up\.  The remaining
portion is an fvwm command which is executed if the user
selects that menu item\.  An empty menu\-label ("") and the
\fBNop\fR

The keywords
\fIDynamicPopUpAction\fR

.RS
.\".PP
Causes a previously defined menu to be popped up in a sticky
manner\.  That is, if the user invokes the menu with a click action
instead of a drag action, the menu stays up\.  The command
\fIdouble\-click\-action\fR
is invoked if the user double\-clicks a button (or hits the key
rapidly twice if the menu is bound to a key) when bringing up the
menu\.  If the double click action is not specified, double
clicking on the menu does nothing\.  However, if the menu begins
with a menu item (i\.e\. not with a title or a separator) and the
double click action is not given, double clicking invokes the
first item of the menu (but only if the pointer really was over
the item)\.
.PP
The pointer is warped to where it was when the menu was invoked if
it was both invoked and closed with a keystroke\.
.PP
The
\fIposition\fR
arguments allow placement of the menu somewhere on the screen, for
example centered on the visible screen or above a title bar\.
Basically it works like this: you specify a
\fIcontext\-rectangle\fR
and an offset to this rectangle by which the upper left corner of
the menu is moved from the upper left corner of the rectangle\.

.RE
.PP
If the context\-rectangle is omitted or illegal (e\.g\. "item" on a
window), "Mouse" is the default\.  Note that not all of these make
sense under all circumstances (e\.g\. "Icon" if the pointer is on a
menu)\.
.PP
The offset values
\fIx\fR
and
\fIy\fR
specify how far the menu is moved from it's default position\.  By
default, the numeric value given is interpreted as a percentage of
the context rectangle's width (height), but with a trailing '\fIm\fR'
the menu's width (height) is used instead\.  Furthermore a trailing '\fIp\fR'
changes the interpretation to mean pixels\.
.PP
Instead of a single value you can use a list of values\.  All
additional numbers after the first one are separated from their
predecessor by their sign\.  Do not use any other separators\.
.PP
If
\fIx\fR or \fIy\fR
are prefixed with "'\fIo\fR<number>" where <number> is an integer, the
menu and the rectangle are moved to overlap at the specified
position before any other offsets are applied\.  The menu and the
rectangle are placed so that the pixel at <number> percent of the
rectangle's width/height is right over the pixel at <number>
percent of the menu's width/height\.  So "o0" means that the
top/left borders of the menu and the rectangle overlap, with
"o100" it's the bottom/right borders and if you use "o50" they are
centered upon each other (try it and you will see it is much
simpler than this description)\.  The default is "o0"\.  The prefix
"o<number>" is an abbreviation for "+<number>\-<number>m"\.
.PP
A prefix of '\fIc\fR'
is equivalent to "o50"\.  Examples:

of the menu items are replaced by the colors from the colorset\.  If
the colorset has a pixmap defined, this pixmap is used as the
background of the menu\.  Note that the

\fIAnimation\fR and

option
\fIPopdownDelayed\fR
the sub menu only pops down after the time specified with the
\fIPopdownDelay\fR
option\.  This comes handy when the pointer often strays off the
menu item when trying to move into the sub menu\.  Whenever there

\fIPopupOffset\fR
requires two integer arguments\.  Both values affect where sub
menus are placed relative to the parent menu\.  If both values are
zero, the left edge of the sub menu overlaps the left edge of the
parent menu\.  If the first value is non\-zero the sub menu is
shifted that many pixels to the right (or left if negative)\.  If
the second value is non\-zero the menu is moved by that many
percent of the parent menu's width to the right or left\.
.PP
\fIPopupActiveArea\fR
requires an integer value between 51 and 100\.  Normally, when the
pointer is over a menu item with a sub menu and the pointer enters
the area that starts at 75% of the menu width, the sub menu is
shown immediately\.  This percentage can be changed with
\fIPopupActiveArea\fR\.
Setting this value to 100 disables this kind of automatic popups
altogether\.  The default value is restored if no or an illegal
value is given\.
.PP
\fITitleWarp\fR and \fI!TitleWarp\fR

milliseconds between two mouse clicks in a menu to be considered
as a double click\.  The default is 450 milliseconds\.  If the
argument is omitted the double click time is reset to this
default\.
.PP
\fISidePic\fR

the mouse\.  Depending on your menu style this may simplify
navigating through the menu\.  \fBAny\fR keystroke while a menu is posted

This means: if the object is defined in the menu (e\.g\. if it is

above a normal menu item (or a menu title), the second is the gap
in pixels below it\.  Negative numbers do not make much sense and
may screw up the menu completely\.  If no arguments are given or
the given arguments are invalid, the built\-in defaults are used:
one pixel above the item or title and two below\.
.PP
\fIVerticalMargins\fR
can be used to add some padding at the top and bottom of menus\.
It takes two numeric arguments that must be positive integers (or
zero)\.  If the number of arguments or its values are incorrect,
fvwm defaults both to 0, which means no padding at all\.  If the
values are correct, the first one is used for the top margin, and
the second one is used for the bottom margin\.

.PP
\fIMouseWheel\fR
controls the ability to scroll the menu using a mouse wheel\.  It takes
one argument, that can be one of
ScrollsPointer, ScrollsMenu, ScrollsMenuBackwards or ActivatesItem\.
ScrollsPointer makes the mouse wheel scroll the pointer over a menu\.
This is the default\.  ScrollsMenu and ScrollsMenuBackwards scroll the menu
beneath the pointer\.  ActivatesItem disables scrolling by mouse wheel and
makes the use of a mouse wheel act as if the menu was clicked\.
If no argument is supplied the default setting is restored\.
.PP
\fIScrollOffPage\fR

This command has two purposes: to bind a menu to a key or mouse

two purposes differ slightly\.  The
\fIposition\fR

\fBMenu\fR\.
The command
\fIdefault\-action\fR
is invoked if the user clicks a button to invoke the menu and
releases it immediately again (or hits the key rapidly twice if
the menu is bound to a key)\.  If the default action is not
specified, double clicking on the menu does nothing\.  However, if
the menu begins with a menu item (i\.e\. not with a title or a
separator) and the default action is not given, double clicking
invokes the first item of the menu (but only if the pointer really
was over the item)\.

\fIEWMHIconicStateWorkaround\fR

windows which are on a different desktops as iconified\.  These
pagers and taskbars use a version of the EWMH specification before

taskbars use the IconicState WM_STATE state to determine if an
application is iconified\.  This state, according to the
ICCCM,
does not imply that a window is iconified (in the usual sense)\.
Turning on this option forces fvwm to establish an equivalence
between the IconicState WM_STATE state and the iconified window\.
This violates

This command is mainly intended for debugging fvwm and no

\fIFakeClick\fR
can simulate mouse button press and release events and pass them
to fvwm or the applications\.  The parameters are a list of
commands which consist of pairs of
\fIcommand\fR
tokens and integer
\fIvalues\fR,
The
\fIpress\fR and \fIrelease\fR
commands are followed by the appropriate mouse button number and
generate a button press or release event on the window below the
pointer\.  The
\fIwait\fR
commands pauses fvwm for the given number of milliseconds\.  The
\fImodifiers\fR

1 to 5 are mapped to
.SM Mod1
to
.SM Mod5
while 6, 7 and 8 are mapped to
.SM Shift
,
.SM Lock
and
.SM Control
\.
The modifier is set for any further button events\.  To release a
modifier key, use the corresponding negative number\.  The
\fIdepth\fR
command determines to which window the button events are
sent\.  With a depth of 1, all events go to the root window,
regardless of the pointer's position\.  With 2, the event is passed
to the top level window under the pointer which is usually the
frame window\.  With 3, events go to the client window\.  Higher
numbers go to successive sub windows\.  Zero (0) goes to the
smallest window that contains the pointer\.  Note that events
propagate upward\.

by a relative pathname, fvwm looks into each directory listed in
turn, and uses the first file found\.

If a directory is given in the form "/some/dir;\.ext", this means
all images in this directory have the extension "\.ext" that should
be forced\.  The original image name (that may contain another
extension or no extension at all) is not probed, instead "\.ext" is
added or replaces the original extension\.  This is useful, for
example, if a user has some image directories with "\.xpm" images
and other image directories with the same names, but "\.png"
images\.

If you use the

\fINoNumInDeskTitle\fR

the desktop name\.  By default, the WindowList menu have a title

If the literal option \fIscreen\fR followed by a

to the given screen\.  The width and height of the screen are used
for the calculations instead of the display dimensions\.  The
\fIscreen\fR
as interpreted as in the
\fBMoveToScreen\fR
command\.
If the optional argument
\fIWarp\fR
is specified the pointer is warped with the window\.  If the single
argument
\fIpointer\fR
is given, the top left corner of the window is moved to the
pointer position before starting the operation; this is mainly
intended for internal use by modules like
\fBFvwmPager\fR\.
.PP
The operation can be aborted with 
.SM Escape

button not set to place the window\.  By default mouse button 2 is set to cancel
the move operation\.  To change this you may use the
\fBMouse\fR

window (see
\fBCurrent\fR

.PP
If the optional arguments
\fIx\fR and
\fIy\fR
are provided, then the window is moved immediately without user
interaction\.  Each argument can specify an absolute or relative
position from either the left/top or right/bottom of the screen\.
By default, the numeric value given is interpreted as a percentage
of the screen width/height, but a trailing '\fIp\fR'
changes the interpretation to mean pixels, while a trailing '\fIw\fR'
means precent of the window width/height\.
To move the window
relative to its current position, add the '\fIw\fR'
(for "window") prefix before the
\fIx\fR and/or \fIy\fR
value\.  To move the window to a position relative to the current
location of the pointer, add the '\fIm\fR'
(for "mouse") prefix\.  To leave either coordinate unchanged,
"\fIkeep\fR" can be specified in place of
\fIx\fR or \fIy\fR\.


For advanced uses, the arguments
\fIx\fR and \fIy\fR
can be used multiple times, but without the prefix '\fIm\fR' or '\fIw\fR'\.

.RS
.\".PP
Without its optional arguments (or if the
\fIbool\fR
bit has the value "\fItoggle\fR")
\fBMaximize\fR
causes the window to alternately switch from a full\-screen size to
its normal size\.  To force a window into maximized (normal) state
you can use a "\fITrue\fR" or "\fIFalse\fR" value for the
\fIbool\fR
argument\.
.PP
With the optional arguments
\fIhorizontal\fR and \fIvertical\fR,
which are expressed as percentage of a full screen, the user can
control the new size of the window\.  An optional suffix '\fIp\fR'
can be used to indicate pixels instead of percents of the screen
size\.  If horizontal is greater than 0 then the horizontal
dimension of the window is set to
\fIhorizontal\fR*screen_width/100\.
If the value is smaller than 0 the size is subtracted from the
screen width, i\.e\. \-25 is the same as 75\.  If
\fIhorizontal\fR
is "\fIgrow\fR", it is maximized to curren
available space until
finding any obstacle\.  The vertical resizing is similar\.  If both
horizontal and vertical values are "grow", it expands vertically
first, then horizontally to find space\.  Instead of the horizontal
"grow" argument, "\fIgrowleft\fR" or "\fIgrowright\fR" can be used
respectively "\fIgrowup\fR" and "\fIgrowdown\fR"\.
The optional
\fIflags\fR
argument is a space separated list containing the following
key words:
\fIewmhiwa\fR, \fIgrowonwindowlayer\fR, \fIgrowonlayers\fR and \fIscreen\fR\.
\fIewmhiwa\fR
causes fvwm to ignore the EWMH working area\.
\fIgrowonwindowlayer\fR
causes the various grow methods to ignore windows with a layer
other than the current layer of the window which is maximized\.
The
\fIgrowonlayers\fR
option must have two integer arguments\.  The first one is the
minimum layer and the second one the maximum layer to use\.
Windows that are outside of this range of layers are ignored by
the grow methods\.  A negative value as the first or second
argument means to assume no minimum or maximum layer\.
\fIscreen\fR
must have an argument which specifies the Xinerama screen on which
to operate\.
It can be 'p' for the primary screen, 'c' for the current
screen (containing the mouse pointer), 'g' for the global screen
or the screen number itself (counting from zero)\.  This option is
only useful with multiple Xinerama screens\.

The highest odd numbered button which has an action bound to it
determines the number of buttons drawn on the left side of the
title bar\.  The highest even number determines the number of right
side buttons which are drawn\.  Actions can be bound to either
mouse buttons or keyboard keys\.

This command works exactly like the
\fBKey\fR
command\.  The only difference is that the binding operates on the
window under the pointer\.  Normal key bindings operate on the
focused window instead\.  The
\fBPointerKey\fR
command can for example be used to bind keys to the root window if
you are using
\fISloppyFocus\fR or
\fIClickToFocus\fR\.
However, some applications (xterm is one example) are unable to
handle this key anymore, even if the pointer is over the xterm
window\.  It is recommended to use the
\fBPointerKey\fR
command only for key combinations that are not needed in any
application window\.

The telephone grid is used by default, to use the numeric pad grid
you should begin the sequence with a '\fIN\fR'\.
Note that a complex motion may produce several different sequences
(see the "netscape"

however, in practice it is preferable to use sequence with less

If you press mouse button 3 and

Note that the

The
\fBStrokeFunc\fR

\fINotStayPressed\fR, \fIEchoSequence\fR, \fIDrawMotion\fR, 
\fIFeedBack\fR and \fIStrokeWidth\fR\.
These options are disabled by default\.
\fIEchoSequence\fR
causes fvwm to Echo the recorded stroke sequence\.
\fIDrawMotion\fR
causes fvwm to draw the mouse motion on the screen\.
\fIFeedBack\fR
causes fvwm to display during a fraction of second the cursor of
the
\fIWAIT\fR
context of the
\fBCursorStyle\fR
command if the recorded stroke sequence corresponds to a stroke
binding\.
\fIStrokeWidth\fR
takes an integer argument, which must be >= 0 and <= 100 and which
defines the width of the line for the
\fIDrawMotion\fR
option\.
.PP
\fINotStayPressed\fR
works only if
\fBStrokeFunc\fR
is used via a
\fBMouse\fR
or a
\fBKey\fR
command\.  This option removes the need to have a button or the key
pressed during the stroke, but you have to do a mouse click or
press the
.SM Return
or
.SM Space
key to finish the mouse motion recording (these keys also work
without the
\fINotStayPressed\fR
option)\.
.PP
You can use the
\fBStrokeFunc\fR
"alone"\.  In this case it works as above with the
\fINotStayPressed\fR
option enabled\.  However,
\fIModifiers\fR,
in general, may not work as expected (i\.e\., in this case use 'A'

.PP
Note that some computers do not support key release events\.  If

\fIFPSortWindowlistByFocus\fR and !\fIFPSortWindowlistByFocus\fR
styles control whether the internal window list is sorted in the
order the windows were focused or in the order they were created\.
The latter is the default for
\fIClickToFocus\fR and \fISloppyFocus\fR\.
.PP
\fBClicking the window to raise\fR
.PP
The styles
\fIFPClickRaisesFocused\fR, \fIFPClickDecorRaisesFocused\fR and
\fIFPClickIconRaisesFocused\fR
allow to raise the window when the interior or the decorations or
the icon of the window is clicked while the window is already
focused\.
.PP
The styles
\fIFPClickRaisesUnfocused\fR, \fIFPClickDecorRaisesUnfocused\fR and
\fIFPClickIconRaisesUnfocused\fR
allow to raise the window when the interior or the decorations or
the icon of the window is clicked while the window is not yet
focused\.
.PP
With the
\fIFPPassRaiseClick\fR
style, the click that was used to raise the window is passed to
the application\.
.PP
With the
\fIFPAllowRaiseClickFunction\fR
style, the click that was used to raise the window can also
trigger a normal action that was bound to the window with the
\fBMouse\fR
command\.
.PP
If the
\fIFPIgnoreRaiseClickMotion\fR
style is used, clicking in a window and then dragging the pointer
with the button held down does not count as the click to raise the
window\.  Instead, the application processes these events
normally\.  This is useful to select text in a terminal window with
the mouse without raising the window\.  However, mouse bindings on
the client window are not guaranteed to work anymore (see
\fBMouse\fR
command\.  Note that this style forces that the initial click is
passed to the application\.  The distance that the pointer must be
moved to trigger this is controlled by the
\fBMoveThreshold\fR
command\.
.PP
\fBGrabbing the focus when a new window is created\fR
.PP
New normal or transient windows with the
\fIFPGrabFocus\fR or \fIFPGrabFocusTransient\fR
style automatically receive the focus when they are created\.
\fIFPGrabFocus\fR
is the default for windows with the
\fIClickToFocus\fR
style\.  Note that even if these styles are disabled, the
application may take the focus itself\.  Fvwm can not prevent this\.
.PP
The
\fIOverrideGrabFocus\fR
style instructs fvwm to never take away the focus from such a
window via the
\fIGrabFocus\fR or \fIGrabFocusTransient\fR
styles\.  This can be useful if you like to have transient windows
receive the focus immediately, for example in a web browser, but
not while you are working in a terminal window or a text
processor\.
.PP
The above three styles are accompanied by
\fIFPReleaseFocus\fR, \fIFPReleaseFocusTransient\fR and
\fIFPOverrideReleaseFocus\fR\.
These control if the focus is returned to another window when the
window is closed\.  Otherwise no window or the window under the
pointer receives the focus\.
.PP
\fIClickToFocusPassesClickOff\fR and \fIClickToFocusPassesClick\fR
controls whether a mouse click to focus a window is sent to the
application or not\.  Similarly,
\fIClickToFocusRaisesOff\fR/\fIMouseFocusClickRaisesOff\fR
and
\fIClickToFocusRaises\fR/\fIMouseFocusClickRaises\fR
control if the window is raised (but depending on the focus
model)\.
.PP
Note: in fvwm versions prior to
2\.5\.3, the "Click\.\.\." options applied only to windows with
\fIClickToFocus\fR
while the "Mouse\.\.\." options applied to windows with a different

.B Window title
.RS
.\".PP
The
\fITitle\fR and !Title
options determine if the window has a title\-bar or not\.  By
default all windows have a title\-bar\.
\fINoTitle\fR
is equivalent to
\fI!Title\fR
but is deprecated\.
.PP
Windows with the
\fITitleAtBottom\fR, \fITitleAtLeft\fR or \fITitleAtRight\fR
style have a title\-bar below, to the left or to the right of the
window instead of above as usual\.  The
\fITitleAtTop\fR
style restores the default placement\.  Even if the window has the
\fI!Title\fR
style set, this affects the
\fBWindowShade\fR
command\.  Please check the
\fBWindowShade\fR
command for interactions between that command and these styles\.
Titles on the left or right side of the windows are augmented by
the following styles:
.PP
Normally, the text in titles on the left side of a window is
rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees from the normal upright
position and 90 degrees clockwise for titles on the right side\.
It can also be rotated in the opposite directions with
\fILeftTitleRotatedCW\fR if \fITitleAtLeft\fR
is used, and with
\fIRightTitleRotatedCCW\fR if \fITitleAtRight\fR
is used\.  The defaults can be restored with
\fILeftTitleRotatedCCW\fR and \fIRightTitleRotatedCW\fR\.
A normal horizontal text may be rotated as well with
\fITopTitleRotated\fR if \fITitleAtTop\fR
is used, and with
\fIBottomTitleRotated\fR if \fITitleAtBottom\fR
is used\.  The defaults can be restored with
\fITopTitleNotRotated\fR and \fIBottomTitleNotRotated\fR\.
.PP
By default the title bar decoration defined using the
\fBTitleStyle\fR
command is rotated following the title text rotation (see the
previous paragraph)\.  This can be disabled by using the
!\fIUseTitleDecorRotation\fR
style\.
\fIUseTitleDecorRotation\fR
reverts back to the default\.
.PP
With the
\fIStippledTitle\fR
style, titles are drawn with the same effect that is usually
reserved for windows with the
\fISticky\fR, \fIStickyAcrossPages\fR or \fIStickyAcrossDesks\fR

\fI!StippledTitle\fR
reverts back to normal titles\.
\fIStippledTitleOff\fR
is equivalent to
\fI!StippledTitle\fR
but is deprecated\.
.PP
\fIColor\fR
takes two arguments\.  The first is the window\-label text color and
the second is the window decorations normal background color\.  The
two colors are separated with a slash\.  If the use of a slash
causes problems then the separate
\fIForeColor\fR and \fIBackColor\fR
options can be used\.
.PP
\fBColorset\fR
takes the colorset number as its sole argument and overrides the
colors set by
\fIColor\fR\.
Instead, the corresponding colors from the given colorset are
used\.  Note that all other features of a colorset are not used\.
Use the
\fBColorset\fR
decoration style in the
\fBTitleStyle\fR and \fIButtonStyle\fR
command for that\.
To stop using the colorset, the colorset number is omitted\.
.PP
The
\fIHilightFore\fR, \fIHilightBack\fR and \fIHilightColorset\fR
style options work exactly like
\fIForeColor\fR, \fIBackColor\fR and \fIColorset\fR
but are used only if the window has the focus\.  These styles
replace the old commands
\fBHilightColor\fR and \fIHilightColorset\fR\.
.PP
\fIBorderColorset\fR
takes the colorset number as its sole argument and overrides the
colors set by
\fIColor\fR or \fIColorset\fR\.
for the window border\.  To stop using a colorset, the argument is
omitted\.
.PP
The
\fIHilightBorderColorset\fR
style option works similarly to
\fIBorderColorset\fR
but is used when the window has the focus\.
.PP
!\fIIconTitle\fR
disables displaying icon labels while the opposite style
\fIIconTitle\fR
enables icon labels (default behaviour)\.
\fINoIconTitle\fR
is equivalent to
\fI!IconTitle\fR
but is deprecated\.
.PP
\fIIconTitleColorset\fR
takes the colorset number as its sole argument and overrides the
colors set by
\fIColor\fR or \fIColorset\fR\.
To stop using this colorset, the argument is omitted\.
.PP
\fIHilightIconTitleColorset\fR
takes the colorset number as its sole argument and overrides the
colors set by
\fBHilightColor\fR or \fIHilightColorset\fR\.
To stop using this colorset, the argument is omitted\.
.PP
\fIIconBackgroundColorset\fR
takes the colorset number as its sole argument and uses it to set
a background for the icon picture\.  By default the icon picture is
not drawn onto a background image\.  To restore the default, the
argument is omitted\.
.PP
\fIIconTitleRelief\fR
takes one numeric argument that may be between \-50 and +50 pixels
and defines the thickness of the 3D relief drawn around the icon
title\.  With negative values the icon title gets a pressed in
look\.  The default is 2 and it is restored if the argument is
omitted\.
.PP
\fIIconBackgroundRelief\fR
takes one numeric argument that may be between \-50 and +50 pixels
and defines the thickness of the 3D relief drawn around the icon
picture background (if any)\.  With negative values the icon
background gets a pressed in look\.  The default is 2 and it is
restored if the argument is omitted\.
.PP
\fIIconBackgroundPadding\fR
takes one numeric argument that may be between 0 and 50 pixels and
defines the amount of free space between the relief of the icon
background picture (if any) and the icon picture\.  The default is 2
and it is restored if the argument is omitted\.
.PP
The
\fIFont\fR and \fIIconFont\fR
options take the name of a font as their sole argument\.  This font
is used in the window or icon title\.  By default the font given in

Where

is the left coordinate,
\fIt\fR

\fIb\fR
is bottom\.  Negative coordinates indicate distance from the right
or bottom of the screen\.
If the first argument is the word
\fIscreen\fR,
the
\fIscr-spec\fR
argument specifies the Xinerama screen on which the IconBox is
defined\.  It can be the usual screen Xinerama specification, 'p',
\(aac', 'g', a screen number or the additional 'w' for the screen
where the window center is located\.  This is only useful with
multiple Xinerama screens\.
The "l t r b" specification is more flexible than an X11 geometry\.
For example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
IconBox \-80 240 \-1 \-1
.fi
.RE
.PP
defines a box that is 80 pixels wide from the right edge,
240 pixels down from the top, and continues to the bottom of
the screen\.

Perhaps it is easier to use is an X11
geometry string though:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
IconBox 1000x70\-1\-1
.fi
.RE
.PP
places an 1000 by 70 pixel icon box on the bottom of the screen
starting in the lower right hand corner of the screen\.
One way to figure out a geometry like this is to use a window
that resizes in pixel increments, for example, xv\.
Then resize and place the xv window where you want the iconbox\.
Then use FvwmIdent to read the windows geometry\.
The icon box is a region of the screen
where fvwm attempts to put icons for any matching window, as long
as they do not overlap other icons\.
Multiple icon boxes can be
defined as overflow areas\.  When the first icon box is full, the
second one is filled\.  All the icon boxes for one style must be
defined in one
\fBStyle\fR
command\.  For example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Style * IconBox \-80 240 \-1 \-1, \e
        IconBox 1000x70\-1\-1
.fi
.RE
.PP
A Style command with the IconBox option replaces any icon box
defined previously by another Style command for the same style\.
Thats why the backslash in the previous example is required\.
.PP
Note: The geometry for the icon box command takes the additional
screen specifier "@w" in case a Xinerama setup is used\.  This
designates the screen where the window center is located\.  The
additional screen specifier is not allowed anywhere else\.
.PP
If you never define an icon box, or you fill all the icon boxes,
fvwm has a default icon box that covers the screen, it fills top
to bottom, then left to right, and has an 80x80 pixel grid\.  To
disable all but the default icon box you can use IconBox without
arguments in a separate
\fBStyle\fR
command\.  To disable all icon boxes including the default icon
box, the argument "none" can be specified\.
.PP
Hint: You can auto arrange your icons in the icon box with a
simple fvwm function\.  Put the "DeiconifyAndRearrange" function
below in your configuration file:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBAddToFunc\fR DeiconifyAndRearrange

shading can be 50% slower than lazy shading, but the latter can

borders, buttons or the title are filled with a tiled pixmap\.
Also, the window handles are not drawn in lazy mode and the border
relief may only be drawn partially right before the window reaches
the shaded state or tight after leaves the unshaded state\.  By
default, fvwm uses lazy mode if there are no bad visual effects
(not counting the window handles) and busy mode otherwise\.  Use

\fIVariablePPosition\fR or \fIVariablePSize\fR
style\.  These styles may sometimes affect the initial placement
and dimensions of new windows (depending on the application)\.  If
windows are created at strange places, try either the
\fIVariablePPosition\fR or \fINoPPosition\fR
styles\.  The
\fIFixedPSize\fR
style may screw up window dimensions for some applications\.  Do Not
use this style in this case\.
.PP
\fIMoveByProgramMethod\fR
affects how fvwm reacts to requests by the application to move its
windows\.  By default, fvwm tries to detect which method to use,
but it sometimes detects the wrong method\.  You may come across a
window that travels across the screen by a few pixels when the
application resizes it, moves to a screen border with the frame
decorations off screen, that remembers its position for the next
time it starts but appears in a slighly shifted position, or that
attepmts to become full screen but has the\.  Try out both options,
\fIUseGravity\fR and \fIIgnoreGravity\fR
on the window (and that window only) and see if that helps\.  By
default, fvwm uses the
\fIAutoDetect\fR
method\.  Once the method was detected, it is never changed again\.
As long as fvwm can not detect the proper method, it uses
\fIIgnoreGravity\fR\.
To force fvwm to retry the detection, use one of the other two
options first and then use
\fIAutoDetect\fR
again\.
.PP
Note: This option was introduced to alleviate a problem with the
ICCCM specification\.  The ICCCM clearly states that the
\fIUseGravity\fR
option should be used, but traditionally applications ignored this
rule\.
.PP
\fIClosable\fR
enables the functions
\fBClose\fR,
\fBDelete\fR
and
\fBDestroy\fR
to be performed on the windows\.  This is on by default\.
The opposite,
\fI!Closable\fR,
inhibits the window to be closed\.
.PP
\fIIconifiable\fR
enables the function
\fBIconify\fR
to be performed on the windows\.
This is on by default\.
The opposite,
\fI!Iconifiable\fR,
inhibits the window from being iconified\.
.PP
\fIMaximizable\fR
enables the function
\fBMaximize\fR
to be performed on the windows\.
This is on by default\.
The opposite,
\fI!Maximizable\fR,
inhibits the window from being maximized\.
.PP
\fIAllowMaximizeFixedSize\fR
enables the function
\fBMaximize\fR
to be performed on windows that are not resizable, unless
maximization has been disabled either using the style
\fI!Maximizable\fR
or through WM hints\.  This is on by default\.  The opposite,
\fI!AllowMaximizeFixedSize\fR,
inhibits all windows that are not resizable from being maximized\.
.PP
\fIResizeHintOverride\fR
instructs fvwm to ignore the program supplied minimum and maximum
size as well as the resize step size (the character size in many
applications)\.
This can be handy for broken applications that refuse to be
resized\.  Do not use it if you do not need it\.  The default
(opposite) style is
\fINoResizeOverride\fR\.
.PP
\fIMinWindowSize [ width [ p ] height [ p ] ]\fR
Tells fvwm the minimum width and height of a window\.  The values
are the percentage of the total screen area\.  If the letter '\fIp\fR'
is appended to either of the values, the numbers are interpreted
as pixels\.  This command is useful for certain versions of xemacs
which freak out if their windows become too small\.  If you omit
he parameters or their values are invalid, both limits are set to
0 pixels (which is the default value)\.
.PP
\fIMaxWindowSize [ width [ p ] height [ p ] ]\fR
Tells fvwm the maximum width and height of a window\.  The values
are the percentage of the total screen area\.  If the letter '\fIp\fR'
is appended to either of the values, the numbers are interpreted
as pixels\.  This command is useful to force large application
windows to be fully visible\.  Neither
\fIheight\fR nor \fIwidth\fR
may be less than 100 pixels\.  If you omit the parameters or their
values are invalid, both limits are set to 32767 pixels (which is
the default)\.
.PP
With
\fIIconifyWindowGroups\fR
all windows in the same window group are iconified and deiconified
at once when any window in the group is (de)iconified\.
The default is
\fIIconifyWindowGroupsOff\fR,
which disables this behavior\.  Although a number of applications
use the window group hint, it is rarely used in a proper way, so
it is probably best to use
\fIIconifyWindowGroups\fR
only for selected applications\.
.PP
The option \fISnapAttraction\fR
affects interactive window movement: If during an interactive
move the window or icon comes within
\fIproximity\fR pixels of another the window
or icon, it is moved to make the borders adjoin\.  The default of 0
means that no snapping happens\.  Calling this command without
arguments turns off snap attraction and restores the default
behavior\.  Please refer also to the \fBSnapGrid\fR
command\.
.PP
The second argument determined is optional and may be set to one of the
five following values: With \fIAll\fR both icons and
windows snap to other windows and other icons\.
\fISameType\fR lets windows snap only to windows, and
icons snap only to icons\.  With \fIWindows\fR windows snap
only to other windows\.  Similarly with \fIIcons\fR icons
snap only to other icons\.  With \fINone\fR no snapping
takes place\.  This option can be useful in conjunction with the following
argument if you only want to snap against the screen edges\.  The default
behavior is \fIAll\fR\.
.PP
The third and last optional argument may be set to one of the
four following values: 
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'With
\fIScreen\fR
the already snapping icons or windows, which is controlled by the second argument, will snap now also to the screen edges\.

.RE
.PP
The option \fISnapGrid\fR defines an
invisible grid on the screen\.  During an interactive move a window
or icon is positioned such that its location (top left corner) is
coincident with the nearest grid point\.  The default
\fIx\-grid\-size\fR and
\fIy\-grid\-size\fR setting are both 1, which
is effectively no grid all\.
.PP
An interactive move with both \fBSnapGrid\fR and
\fISnapAttraction\fR results in the window
being moved to be adjacent to the nearest window border (if within
snap proximity) or grid position\.  The window moves the shortest
distance possible to satisfy both \fBSnapGrid\fR and
\fISnapAttraction\fR\.  Note that the x and y
coordinates are not coupled\.  For example, a window may snap to
another window on the x axis while snapping to a grid point on the
y axis\.  Using this style without arguments reinstates the default
settings\.
.PP
The styles \fIEdgeMoveDelay\fR and
\fIEdgeResizeDelay\fR tells how hard it
should be to change the desktop viewport by moving or resizing a
window over the edge of the screen\.  The parameter tells how many
milliseconds the pointer must spend on the screen edge before fvwm
moves the viewport\.  The command \fBEdgeScroll\fR
determines how far the viewport is scrolled\.  If \-1 is given as
the delay, page flipping is disabled completely\.  The defaults are
no delay for moving (0) and no flipping for resizing (\-1)\.  Using
these styles without any argument restores the default
settings\.  Note that, with
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBEdgeScroll\fR 0 0
.fi
.RE
.PP
it is still possible to move or resize windows across the
edge of the current screen\.  See also \fBEdgeThickness\fR\.
.PP
The option \fIEdgeMoveResistance\fR
makes it easier to place a window directly adjacent to the
screen's or xinerama screen's border\.  It takes one or two
parameters\.  The first parameter tells how many pixels over the
edge of the screen a window's edge must move before it actually
moves partially off the screen\.  The optional second parameter
does the same as the first, but for individual Xinerama screens\.
If omitted, the value of the first parameter is assumed for this
type of movement\.  Set the second parameter to 0 to zero to ignore
individual xinerama screen edges\.  Note that the center of the
window being moved determines the xinerama screen on which the
window should be kept\.  Both values are 0 by default\.  To restore
the defaults, the option \fIEdgeMoveResistance\fR can be used without any
parameters\.
.PP
The option \fIInitialMapCommand\fR allows
for any valid fvwm command or function to run when the window is 
initially mapped by fvwm\.  Example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBStyle\fR MyWindow StartsOnPage 0 0, InitialMapCommand Iconify
.fi

.TP
.B Window Manager placement
.RS
.\".PP
Applications can place windows at a particular spot on the screen
either by window manager hints or a geometry specification\.  When
they do neither, then the window manager steps in to find a place
for the window\.  Fvwm knows several ways to deal with this
situation\.  The default is
\fITileCascadePlacement\fR\.
.PP
\fIPositionPlacement\fR
[\fICenter\fR|\fIUnderMouse\fR|\fImove\-arguments\fR]
When used without an argument, new windows are placed in the
top left corner of the display\.  With the argument
\fICenter\fR,
all new window appear at the center of the screen, and with
\fIUnderMouse\fR,
windows are centered under the mouse pointer where possible\.  If the window
is unable to fit on the screen because the pointer is at the edge of the
screen, then the window is forced on\-screen using this option\.  If any other
\fImove\-arguments\fR
are given, they are interpreted exactly as the
\fBMove\fR
command does (with the exception that references to the current
window position do not work as the window has not been placed
yet)\.
.PP
\fICascadePlacement\fR
automatically place new windows in a cascading fashion\.
.PP
\fITileCascadePlacement\fR
automatically places new windows in a smart location \- a location
in which they do not overlap any other windows on the screen\.  If
no such position can be found
\fICascadePlacement\fR
is used as a fall\-back method\.
.PP
\fITileManualPlacement\fR
This is the same as
\fITileCascadePlacement\fR,
but uses
\fIManualPlacement\fR
as the fall\-back method\.
.PP
\fIMinOverlapPlacement\fR
automatically places new windows in a location in which the
overlapping area in pixels of other windows is minimized\.
By default this placement policy tries to avoid
overlapping icons and windows on higher layers\.
This can be configured with the
\fIMinOverlapPlacementPenalties\fR
style\.
.PP
\fIMinOverlapPercentPlacement\fR
is similar to
\fIMinOverlapPlacement\fR
but tries to minimize the overlapped percentages of other windows
instead of the overlapped area in pixels\.  This placement policy
tries to avoid covering other windows completely and tries even
harder not to cover small windows\.
This can be configured with the
\fIMinOverlapPlacementPenalties\fR

\fIMinOverlapPercentPlacementPenalties\fR
styles\.

To reset this style to the default values, prefix it with a '!'\.  This style configures the

placement policy\.
The
\fInormal\fR
factor affects normal windows, the
\fIontop\fR
factor affects windows with a greater layer than the window being
placed, the
\fIicon\fR
factor affects icons, the
\fIsticky\fR

\fIbelow\fR
factor affects windows with a smaller layer than the window being
placed, the
\fIstrut\fR

window being placed has the
\fIEWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea\fR
style and windows with an EWMH strut hint (i\.e\., a "please do not
cover me" hint) if the window being placed has the
\fIEWMHPlacementUseDynamicWorkingArea\fR
style\.  These factors represent the amount of area that these
types of windows (or area) are counted as, when a new window is
placed\.  For example, by default the area of ontop windows is
counted 5 times as much as normal windows\.  So
\fIMinOverlapPlacement\fR and \fIMinOverlapPercentPlacement\fR
covers 5 times as much area of another window before it will
cover an ontop window\.  To treat ontop windows the same as other
windows, set this to 1\.  To really, really avoid putting windows
under ontop windows, set this to a high value, say 1000\.  This
style affects the window already mapped and not the window which
is currently placed\.  There is one exception to this rule: in the
case of the window being placed has the
\fIEWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea\fR

\fIstrut\fR
factor affects the placed window\.

\fIStartsOnDesk\fR
takes a numeric argument which is the desktop number on which the
window should be initially placed\.  Note that standard Xt programs
can also specify this via a resource (e\.g\. "\-xrm '*Desk: 1'")\.
.PP
\fIStartsOnPage\fR
takes 1, 2, or 3 numeric arguments\.  If one or three arguments are
given, the first (or only) argument is the desktop number\.  If
three arguments are given, the 2nd and 3rd arguments identify the
x,y page position on the virtual window\.  If two arguments are
given, they specify the page position, and indicate no desk
preference\.  If only one argument is given,
\fIStartsOnPage\fR
functions exactly like
\fIStartsOnDesk\fR\.
For those standard Xt programs which understand this usage, the
starting desk/page can also be specified via a resource (e\.g\.,
"\-xrm '*page: 1 0 2'")\.
\fIStartsOnPage\fR
in conjunction with
\fISkipMapping\fR
is a useful technique when you want to start an app on some other
page and continue with what you were doing, rather than waiting
for it to appear\.
.PP
\fIStartsOnScreen\fR
takes one argument\.  It can be 'p' for the primary screen, 'c' for
the current screen (containing the mouse pointer), 'g' for the
global screen or the screen number itself (counting from zero)\.  A
new window is placed on the specified Xinerama screen\.  The
default is to place windows on the screen that contains the mouse
pointer at the time the window is created\.  However, those windows
which are not placed by fvwm (i\.e\., those with a USPosition hint
from a user specified geometry) are normally placed in a position
relative to the global screen\.  The
\fIStartsOnScreen\fR
style is also useful to cause these windows to be placed relative
to a specific Xinerama screen\.  For example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

Would cause all windows, including those with their own geometry
to be placed relative to the current Xinerama screen rather than
the global screen\.  For those standard Xt programs which
understand this usage, the starting desk/page can also be
specified via a resource (e\.g\., "\-xrm '*fvwmscreen: c'")\.
('fvwmscreen' was chosen because some applications already use
\(aa\.screen' for other purposes\.)
.PP
\fIStartsOnPageIncludesTransients\fR
causes the
\fIStartsOnPage\fR
style to be applied even for transient windows\.  This is not
usually useful, since transients are usually pop ups that you want
to appear in your visible viewport; but occasionally an
application uses a transient for something like a startup window
that needs to be coerced into place\.
.PP
\fIManualPlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage\fR
suppresses
\fIStartsOnPage\fR or \fIStartsOnDesk\fR
placement in the event that both
\fIManualPlacement\fR and \fISkipMapping\fR
are in effect when a window is created\.  This prevents you from
interactively placing a window and then wondering where it
disappeared to, because it got placed on a different desk or page\.
\fIManualPlacementHonorsStartsOnPage\fR
allows this to happen anyway\.  The option has no effect if
\fISkipMapping\fR
is not in effect, because fvwm switches to the proper desk/page to
perform interactive placement\.  The default is
\fIManualPlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage\fR;
\fIManualPlacementHonorsStartsOnPage\fR

\fIBackingStore\fR

for the "ActiveDown" and "InactiveDown" states:  When a button is
pressed, the relief is inverted\.  Because of this, to obtain the
raised look in "ActiveDown" or "InactiveDown" states you must
specify the opposite of the desired relief (i\.e\.
\fISunk\fR
for "ActiveDown" or "InactiveDown")\.  This behavior is consistent,

Button styles are classified as non\-destructive, partially
destructive, or fully destructive\.  Non\-destructive styles do not
affect the image\.  Partially destructive styles can obscure some or
all parts of the underlying image (i\.e\.
\fIPixmap\fR)\.
Fully destructive styles obscure the entire underlying image (i\.e\.
\fISolid\fR
or one of the
\fIgradient\fR
styles)\.  Thus, if stacking styles with
\fBAddButtonStyle\fR (or \fBAddTitleStyle\fR
for title\-bars), use care in sequencing styles to minimize redraw\.
.PP
The available styles are:
.PP
\fISimple\fR, \fIDefault\fR, \fISolid\fR, \fIColorset\fR, \fIVector\fR,
\fI?Gradient\fR, \fIPixmap\fR, \fIAdjustedPixmap\fR,
\fIShrunkPixmap\fR, \fIStretchedPixmap\fR, \fITiledPixmap\fR, \fIMiniIcon\fR
.PP
The description of these styles and their arguments follow:
.PP
The
\fISimple\fR
style does nothing\.  There are no arguments, and this style is an
example of a non\-destructive button style\.
.PP
The
\fIDefault\fR
style conditionally accepts one argument: a number which specifies
the default button number to load\.  If the style command given is
\fBButtonStyle\fR or \fBAddButtonStyle\fR,
the argument is optional (if given, it overrides the current button)\.
If a command other than
\fBButtonStyle\fR or \fBAddButtonStyle\fR
is used, the number must be specified\.
.PP
The
\fISolid\fR
style fills the button with a solid color\.  The relief border
color is not affected\.  The color is specified as a single
argument\.  This style is fully destructive\.
.PP
The
\fIColorset\fR
\fIcs\fR
[\fIalpha\fR]
style fills the button with the Colorset
\fIcs\fR\.
The optional
\fIalpha\fR
argument is a percentage between 0 and 100\.  It causes fvwm to
merge the colorset background onto the button using this
percentage\.  If the percentage is 0 the colorset background is
hidden and if it is 100 the colorset background is fully
applied\.  The default is 100\.  So, the destructiveness depends on the
\fIalpha\fR
argument\.
.PP
The
\fIVector\fR
\fInum\fR
\fIX\fR\fB[\fR\fIoffset\fR\fBp]x\fR\fIY\fR\fB[\fR\fIoffset\fR\fBp]@\fR\fIC\fR\fB \.\.\.\fR
style draws a line pattern\.  Since this is a standard button style,
the keyword
\fIVector\fR
is optional,
\fInum\fR
is a number of point specifications of the form
\fIX\fR\fB[\fR\fIoffset\fR\fBp]x\fR\fIY\fR\fB[\fR\fIoffset\fR\fBp]@\fR\fIC\fR\fB \.\.\.\fR
\fIX\fR and \fIY\fR
are point coordinates inside the button, given in percents
(from 0 to 100)\.  An optional absolute
\fIoffset\fR
in pixels, can be given as "+<offset>p" for a positive or
"\-<offset>p" for a negative offset\.
.PP
\fIC\fR
specifies a line color (0 \- the shadow color, 1 \- the highlight
color, 2 \- the background color, 3 \- the foreground color, 4 \-
only move the point, do not draw)\.  The first point color is not
used\.  You can use up to 10000 points in a line pattern\.  This
style is partially destructive\.
.PP
The specification is a little cumbersome:

then the button 2 decoration uses a 4\-point pattern consisting of
a line from (x=50,y=30) to (70,70) in the shadow color (@0), and

styles denote color gradients\.  Fill in the question mark with any

styles are fully destructive\.
.PP
The
\fIPixmap\fR
style displays a pixmap\.  A pixmap should be specified as an
argument\.  For example, the following would give button number 2
the same pixmap for all 4 states (2 active and 2 inactive), and
button number 4 all different pixmaps\.

.RE

The pixmap specification can be given as an absolute or relative
pathname (see
\fBImagePath\fR)\.
If the pixmap cannot be found, the button style reverts to
\fISimple\fR\.
Flags specific to the
\fIPixmap\fR
style are
\fILeft\fR, \fIRight\fR, 
\fITop\fR, and \fIBottom\fR\.
These can be used to justify the pixmap (default is centered for
both directions)\.  Pixmap transparency is used for the color
"None\." This style is partially destructive\.
.PP

\fIAdjustedPixmap\fR

\fIPixmap\fR
style\.  But the image is resized to exactly fit the button\.

The
\fIShrunkPixmap\fR

This command is useful only for an ewmh compliant pager or taskbar
(as kpager or kicker taskbar) and not for fvwm modules (
\fBFvwmPager\fR or \fBFvwmIconMan\fR)\.  It causes a
compliant application to consider at least
\fInum\fR
desktops (desktop 0 to desktop
\fInum\fR\-1)\.
The optional argument
\fImax\fR
causes a compliant application to never consider more than
\fImax\fR
desktops\.  If
\fImax\fR
is 0 (the default) there is no limitation\.  The actual number of
desktops is determined dynamically\.  It is at least
\fInum\fR,

current desktop is desktop d\-1) and d is less or equal to
\fImax\fR

Moreover, a compliant pager can ask to change
\fInum\fR
itself\.
This is accepted by fvwm only if this number is
less than or equal to

that works on global conditions unrelated to windows\.  The syntax
of the conditions is described below\.  For readability, the list
of conditions is located at the end of this section\.
.TP
.B Return Codes
.RS
.\".PP
All commands in this section (unless specifically stated for the
command) also have a return code that can be 1 (if the condition
was met) or 0 (if the condition was not met)\.  Some commands may
return \-1 which means that an error occurred and the return code
is useless\.  The
\fBBreak\fR
command returns \-2\.  Additionally, the return codes of commands
run in a complex functions are passed to the invoking complex
function\.  The return code is used by the
\fBTestRc\fR
command\.  Please refer to the commands' description for examples\.
The return code can also be accessed through the variable
\fI$[cond\.rc]\fR\.
Non conditional commands do not modify the return code of the last
conditional command\.  Important note: return codes are only
defined inside functions created with the
\fBAddToFunc\fR
command and are not inherited by sub functions\.  To run a command
without altering the return code, the
\fBKeepRc\fR
command can be used\.

.TP
.B The Ring of Windows
.RS
.\".PP
Fvwm stores windows in a ring internally\.  Think of the focused
window as a cursor on the current position in the ring\.  The
\fBNext\fR
command and many other commands search forwards through the ring
for a matching window, and
\fBPrev\fR
searches backwards\.  The windows in the ring are either ordered by
creation time (if the
\fI!FPSortWindowlistByFocus\fR,
\fINeverFocus\fR or \fIMouseFocus\fR
styles are used) or by the last time they had the focus\.
.RE
.TP
.B List of Conditional Commands
.RS
.\".TP
\fBAll\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [(\fIconditions\fR)] \fIcommand\fR
.RS
.\".PP
Execute
\fIcommand\fR
on all windows meeting the conditions\.  It returns 1 if any window
matches the condition and 0 otherwise\.  The execution starts at the top of the
window ring and continues towards the bottom\.  The
\fIoptions\fR
can be any combination of
\fIReverse\fR and \fIUseStack\fR\.
If the option
\fIReverse\fR
is given the execution order is reversed\.  The option
\fIUseStack\fR
makes All use the stacking order instead of the window ring when walking
through windows\.
See the \fBConditions\fR section for a list of conditions\.
.PP
This command implies the conditions
\fICirculateHit\fR, \fICirculateHitIcon\fR and \fICirculateHitShaded\fR\.
They can be turned off by specifying
\fI!CirculateHit\fR
etc\.  explicitly\.
.RE
.TP
\fBAny\fR [(\fIconditions\fR)] \fIcommand\fR
.RS
.\".PP
Performs
\fIcommand\fR
if any window which satisfies all
\fIconditions\fR
exists\.  The command is run in the context of the root window\.
See the \fBConditions\fR section for a list of conditions\.
.RE
.TP
\fBBreak\fR [\fIlevels\fR]
.RS
.\".PP
If the break command is used in a function, function execution is
terminated immediately\.  Further commands of the function are not
processed\.  Normally, all nested invocations of complex functions
are left\.  An optional integer number
\fIlevels\fR
may be given to break out of the given number of nested functions
and continue execution of a higher level function\.
The
\fBBreak\fR
command always has the return code \-2\.  Example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBAddToFunc\fR PickWindowRaiseAndDeiconify
+ I \fBPick\fR
+ I \fBTestRc\fR (Error) Break
+ I \fBRaise\fR

.TP
\fBCurrent\fR [(\fIconditions\fR)] \fIcommand\fR
.RS
.\".PP
Performs
\fIcommand\fR
on the currently focused window if it satisfies all
\fIconditions\fR\.
See the \fBConditions\fR section for a list of conditions\.
.PP
This command implies the conditions
\fICirculateHit\fR, \fICirculateHitIcon\fR and \fICirculateHitShaded\fR\.
They can be turned off by specifying
\fI!CirculateHit\fR
etc\.  explicitly\.
.RE
.TP
\fBDirection\fR [FromPointer] \fIdirection\fR [(\fIconditions\fR)] \fIcommand\fR
.RS
.\".PP
Performs
\fIcommand\fR
(typically
\fBFocus\fR)
on a window in the given direction which satisfies all
\fIconditions\fR\.
Normally, the center of the currently focused window or the
context window in which the command was invoked is taken as the
starting point\.  Lacking such a window, or when the
\fIFromPointer\fR
option is given, the current position of the pointer is taken as
the starting point\.  The
\fIdirection\fR
may be one of "North", "Northeast", "East", "Southeast", "South",
"Southwest", "West", "Northwest" and "Center"\.  Which window
\fBDirection\fR
selects depends on angle and distance between the center points of
the windows\.  Closer windows are considered a better match than
those farther away\.  The
\fICenter\fR
direction simply selects the window closest to the starting point\.
Returns \-1 if an invalid direction was given\.
See the \fBConditions\fR section for a list of conditions\.
.RE
.TP
\fBKeepRc\fR \fIcommand\fR
.RS
.\".PP
Runs the
\fIcommand\fR
but does not alter the return code of the previous command\.  Note:
\fBKeepRc\fR
is treated as a prefix to its
\fIcommand\fR\.
Expansion of the command line is done as if
\fBKeepRc\fR
was not there\.
.RE
.TP
\fBNext\fR [(\fIconditions\fR)] \fIcommand\fR
.RS
.\".PP
Performs
\fIcommand\fR
(typically
\fBFocus\fR)
on the next window which satisfies all
\fIconditions\fR\.
If the command is running in a window context, it starts looking
for a matching window from there\.  Otherwise it starts at the
focused window\.
See \fBConditions\fR section for a list of conditions\.
.RE
.TP
\fBNone\fR [(\fIconditions\fR)] \fIcommand\fR
.RS
.\".PP
Performs
\fIcommand\fR
if no window which satisfies all
\fIconditions\fR
exists\.  The command is run in the context of the root window\.
Returns 1 if no window matches the conditions and 0 otherwise\.
See \fBConditions\fR section for a list of conditions\.
.PP
This command implies the conditions
\fICirculateHit\fR, \fICirculateHitIcon\fR and \fICirculateHitShaded\fR\.
They can be turned off by specifying
\fI!CirculateHit\fR
etc\.  explicitly\.
.RE
.TP
\fBNoWindow\fR \fIcommand\fR
.RS
.\".PP
Performs
\fIcommand\fR,
but removes the window context if any\.  This is not really a
conditional command, but a prefix that may be useful in menu items
that should operate without a window even if such menu is bound to
window decorations\.
.RE
.TP
\fBPick\fR [(\fIconditions\fR)] \fIcommand\fR
.RS
.\".PP
\fBPick\fR
works like
\fBFunction\fR
if invoked in the context of a window\.  If invoked in the root
window, it first asks the user to pick a window and then executes
the
\fIcommand\fR
in the context of that window\.  This avoids annoying multiple
selections with complex functions\.  The command is executed only
if the given
\fIconditions\fR
are met\.  Returns \-1 if no window was selected\.
See \fBConditions\fR section for a list of conditions\.
.PP
This command implies the conditions
\fICirculateHit\fR, \fICirculateHitIcon\fR and \fICirculateHitShaded\fR\.
They can be turned off by specifying
\fI!CirculateHit\fR
etc\.  explicitly\.
.RE
.TP
\fBPointerWindow\fR [(\fIconditions\fR)] \fIcommand\fR
.RS
.\".PP
Performs
\fIcommand\fR
if the window under the pointer satisfies all
\fIconditions\fR\.
Returns \-1 if there is no window under the pointer\.
See \fBConditions\fR section for a list of conditions\.
.PP
This command implies the conditions
\fICirculateHit\fR, \fICirculateHitIcon\fR and \fICirculateHitShaded\fR\.
They can be turned off by specifying
\fI!CirculateHit\fR
etc\.  explicitly\.
.RE
.TP
\fBPrev\fR [(\fIconditions\fR)] \fIcommand\fR
.RS
.\".PP
Performs
\fIcommand\fR
(typically
\fBFocus\fR)
on the previous window which satisfies all
\fIconditions\fR\.
If the command is running in a window context, it starts looking
for a matching window from there\.  Otherwise it starts at the
focused window\.
See \fBConditions\fR section for a list of conditions\.
.RE
.TP
\fBScanForWindow\fR [FromPointer] \fIdir1\fR \fIdir2\fR [(\fIconditions\fR)] \fIcommand\fR
.RS
.\".PP
Performs \fIcommand\fR
(typically \fBFocus\fR)
on a window in the given direction which satisfies all
\fIconditions\fR\.
Normally, the center of the currently focused window or the
context window in which the command was invoked is taken as the
starting point\.  Lacking such a window, or when the
\fIFromPointer\fR
option is given, the current position of the pointer is taken as
the starting point\.  The direction
\fIdir1\fR
may be one of "North", "NorthEast", "East", "SouthEast", "South",
"SouthWest", "West", and "NorthWest"\.  Which window
\fBScanForWindow\fR
selects depends first on the position along the primary axis given
by
\fIdir1\fR\.
If any windows have the exact same coordinate along the primary
axis, the secondary direction is used to order the windows\.  The
direction \fIdir2\fR
may be one of the same set of values as
\fIdir1\fR\.
If \fIdir2\fR
is not perfectly perpendicular to
\fIdir1\fR,
ScanForWindow returns a failure\.  When using ScanForWindow
repeatedly with the same arguments, it is guaranteed that all
windows matching the conditions will eventually be found\.  If the
focus reaches a limit along the primary axis, it will wrap around
to the opposite side\.  Returns \-1 if an invalid direction was
given\.
See \fBConditions\fR section for a list of conditions\.
.RE
.TP
\fBTest\fR [(\fItest\-conditions\fR)] \fIcommand\fR
.RS
.\".PP
Performs \fIcommand\fR if all
\fItest\-conditions\fR are satisfied\.  The
\fItest\-conditions\fR
are keywords with possible arguments from the list below
and are separated by commas or whitespace\.  They include:
\fIVersion operator x\.y\.z\fR,
\fIEnvIsSet varname\fR,
\fIEnvMatch varname pattern\fR,
\fIEdgeHasPointer direction\fR,
\fIEdgeIsActive direction\fR,

\fIX\fR and
\fII\fR\.
A test\-condition prefixed with "!" is negated\.
.PP
The
\fIVersion\fR \fIoperator x\.y\.z\fR
test\-condition is fulfilled if the logical condition of the expression is
true\.  Valid \fIoperator\fR values are:
\fI>=\fR,
\fI>\fR,
\fI<=\fR,
\fI<\fR,
\fI==\fR

test\-condition is true if the given environment variable is set\.
The
\fIEnvMatch\fR \fIvarname pattern\fR
test\-condition is true if
\fIpattern\fR
matches the given environment variable value\.
The pattern may contain special "*" and "?" chars\.
.PP
The
\fIEdgeHasPointer\fR
[\fIdirection\fR]
test\-condition is true if the edge in the given direction currently
contains the pointer\.
The
\fIEdgeIsActive\fR
[\fIdirection\fR]
test\-condition is true if the edge in the given direction currently is
active\.  An edge is active, and can contain a pointer if either a
command is bound to it or edge scroll is available in that
direction\.  The direction may be one of
\fI Any\fR,\fI North\fR,\fI Top\fR,\fI Up\fR,\fI West\fR,\fI Left\fR,\fI South\fR,\fI Bottom\fR,
\fI Down\fR,\fI Right\fR and \fI East\fR\.
If no direction is specified \fIAny\fR is assumed\.
.PP
The
\fIStart\fR
test\-condition is the same as either
\fIInit\fR or \fIRestart\fR\.
It is only true on startup or restart prior and during
\fBStartFunction\fR
execution\.
The
\fIExit\fR
test\-condition is the same as either
\fIQuit\fR or \fIToRestart\fR\.
It is only valid on shutdown during
\fBExitFunction\fR
function execution\.
.PP
The \fITrue\fR and \fIFalse\fR
test\-conditions are unconditionally true and false\.
.PP
Additionally, if a test\-condition name is not recognized, the Error
return code is set and the command is not executed\.

\fIR\fR \fIfile\fR,
\fIW\fR \fIfile\fR,

\fBTestRc\fR [([!]\fIreturncode\fR)] \fIcommand\fR
.RS

Performs
\fIcommand\fR
if the last conditional command returned the value
\fIreturncode\fR\.
Instead of the numeric values 0 (no match), 1 (match), \-1 (error),
and \-2 (break) the symbolic names "\fINoMatch\fR",
"\fIMatch\fR", "\fIError\fR" and
"\fIBreak\fR" can be used\.  If no
\fIreturncode\fR
is given, the default 0 is assumed\.  If the return code is
prefixed with '!', the command is executed if
\fIreturncode\fR
does not match the value returned by the conditional command\.
The \fBTestRc\fR
command can only be used inside functions\.  If the

\fBThisWindow\fR
executes the specified

\fBThisWindow\fR
is never interactive\.  The command is executed only if the given
\fIconditions\fR

\fBWindowId\fR [\fIid\fR]\ [(\fIconditions\fR)] | [root\ [\fIscreen\fR]] \fIcommand\fR
.RS
.\".PP
The
\fBWindowId\fR
command looks for a specific window
\fIid\fR
and runs the specified
\fIcommand\fR
on it\.  The second form of syntax retrieves the window id of the
root window of the given
\fIscreen\fR\.
If no
\fIscreen\fR
is given, the current screen is assumed\.  The window indicated by
\fIid\fR
may belong to a window not managed by fvwm or even a window on a
different screen\.  Although most commands can not operate on such
windows, there are some exceptions, for example the
\fBWarpToWindow\fR
command\.
Returns \-1 if no window with the given id exists\.
See \fBConditions\fR section for a list of conditions\.
.PP
This command implies the conditions
\fICirculateHit\fR, \fICirculateHitIcon\fR and \fICirculateHitShaded\fR\.
They can be turned off by specifying
\fI!CirculateHit\fR
etc\.  explicitly\.
.PP

WindowId root 1 \fBWarpToWindow\fR 50 50
WindowId $0 (Silly_Popup) \fBDelete\fR

.RE
.PP
In the past this command was mostly useful for functions used with
the
\fBWindowList\fR
command, or for selective processing of
\fBFvwmEvent\fR
calls (as in the last example), but currently these handler functions
are called within a window context, so this command is not really
needed in these cases\.  Still it may be useful if, for example, the
window id should be stored in the environment variable for a further
proceeding\.

.B Conditions
.RS
.\".PP
The
\fIconditions\fR
that may be given as an argument to any conditional command are a
list of keywords separated by commas, enclosed in
parentheses\.  Unless stated otherwise, conditional commands accept
all the conditions listed below\.  Note that earlier versions of
fvwm required the conditions to be separated by whitespace instead
of commas and enclosed in brackets instead of parentheses
(this is still supported for backward compatibility)\.
.PP
In addition, the
\fIconditions\fR
may include one or more window names to match to\.  If more than
one window name is given, all of them must match\.  The window
name, icon name, class, and resource are considered when
attempting to find a match\.  Each name may include the wildcards '*' and '?', and may consist of two or more alternatives,
separated by the character '|', which acts as an OR operator\.  (If
OR operators are used, they must not be separated by spaces from
the names\.) Each window name can begin with '!', which prevents
\fIcommand\fR
if any of the window name, icon name, class or resource match\.
However, '!' must not be applied to individual names in a group
separated by OR operators; it may only be applied to the beginning
of the group, and then it operates on the whole group\.

The

Fvwm stops processing any commands and user input until the module
sends a string beginning with "NOP FINISHED STARTUP" back to fvwm\.
If the optional
\fITimeout\fR
is given fvwm gives up if the module sent no input back to fvwm
for
\fIsecs\fR
seconds\.  If the
\fIExpect\fR
option is given, fvwm waits for the given
\fIstring\fR
instead\.
\fBModuleSynchronous\fR
should only be used during fvwm startup to enforce the order in
which modules are started\.  This command is intended for use with
the (currently hypothetical) module that should be in place before
other modules are started\.
.PP
Warning: It is quite easy to hang fvwm with this command, even if
a timeout is given\.  Be extra careful choosing the string to wait
for\.  Although all modules in the fvwm distribution send back the
"NOP FINISHED STARTUP" string once they have properly started up,
this may not be the case for third party modules\.  Moreover, you

If you need a native restart, we suggest only to use

.SS Colorsets

Colorsets are a powerful method to control colors\.  Colorsets
create appearance resources that are shared by fvwm and its
modules\.  When a colorset is modified all parts of fvwm react to
that change\.  A colorset includes a foreground color, background
color, shadow and highlight color (often based on the background
color), background face (this includes images and all kinds of
gradients)\.  There is a way to render background face and specify
other color operations\.

In the 2\.4\.x versions a special module
\fBFvwmTheme\fR

Each colorset has four colors, an optional pixmap and an optional
shape mask\.  The four colors are used by modules as the
foreground, background, highlight and shadow colors\.  When a
colorset is created it defaults to a foreground of black and
background of gray\.  The background and foreground are marked as
"average" and "contrast" (see later) so that just specifying a
pixmap or gradient gives sensible results\.

\fITiledPixmap\fR

Due to the way X implements transparency no guarantees can be made

Using outline move and resize (see the
\fBOpaqueMoveSize\fR
command and the
\fIResizeOpaque\fR
\fBStyle\fR
option) as well as setting the
\fIWindowShadeShrinks\fR
style may help\.  The transparency achieved with
\fITransparent\fR
depends on whether the colorset is applied to the foreground or
the background of a window\.  In the second case the transparency is
relative to the parent window of the window on which the colorset
is defined\.  For example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf

Colorset 18 Transparent
Colorset 19 Transparent

*\fBFvwmIconMan\fR: Colorset 12

.fi
.RE
.PP
The Colorset IconMan option defines the IconMan window background,
but the PlainColorset and the FocusColorset are drawn on the
foreground\.  So, the transparency of the IconMan buttons is
achieved by drawing nothing\.  Now if this IconMan is swallowed in
an FvwmButtons as:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBFvwmButtons\fR:(Colorset 10, Swallow "FvwmIconMan" 'FvwmIconMan')
.fi
.RE
.PP
then,
\fBFvwmIconMan\fR
becomes a child of
\fBFvwmButtons\fR
and it is transparent relative to
\fBFvwmButtons\fR\.
So, in this case
\fBFvwmIconMan\fR
uses Colorset 10 as background\.  If you want root transparency use
the
\fIRootTransparent\fR
option\.
\fBFvwmButtons\fR,
\fBFvwmIconMan\fR,
\fBFvwmIdent\fR,
\fBFvwmScroll\fR
and
\fBFvwmTaskBar\fR
are relatively simple\.  There is one main colorset option which
defines the background of the window and the other colorsets (if
any) are drawn on the foreground\.  The case of
\fBFvwmWinList\fR and
\fBFvwmProxy\fR
are simpler\.  With
\fBFvwmWinList\fR
all the colorsets are drawn on the foreground and with
\fBFvwmProxy\fR
the two colorsets refer to the window backgrounds\.
\fBFvwmPager\fR
is more complicated as almost everything in the pager are windows
with some parental relations (the mini windows are the child and
the desktops are the parents and all this is complicated by the
hilighted page)\.  So, the colorsets apply to the background of
these windows\.  You should experiment\.  For
\fBFvwmForm\fR and
\fBFvwmScript\fR
the situation is similar\.  There is a main window (a child of the
root window) which corresponds to the main colorset and most of
the widgets are windows which are children of the main window\.
\fITint\fR
may work or not with the
\fITransparent\fR
option\.  When the colorset is drawn on the foreground
\fITint\fR
should work\.  In some cases, tinting may be very slow\.  Tinting may
work with fvwm menu (without animation)\.  Tinting may work better
if your X server has backing store enabled (try xdpyinfo to see if
this the case)\.  There is a chance that the backing store support
of your X server does not work well with the terrible hack used to
Tint the ParentRelative Pixmap\.  So, to get tinted root
transparency it is more safe to use the
\fIRootTransparent\fR
option\.
.PP
\fIRootTransparent\fR [ \fIbuffer\fR ]
creates a root transparent background\.  To make this option work,
you must use an \fBEsetroot\fR compatible program, fvwm\-root with the
\-\-retain\-pixmap option or \fBFvwmBacker\fR with the RetainPixmap option
(and colorset or solid backgrounds)\.  The
\fIbuffer\fR
keyword is useful only when the
\fITint\fR
option is used too\.  This speeds up creation of windows which use
the colorset (useful for fvwm menus) at the cost of memory
usage\.  It also speeds up opaque move and resize which can be
unacceptably slow without
\fIbuffer\fR\.
However, this option may add a lot of memory to your X server
(depending on the size of the image used to set the
background)\.  In summary, using outline move and resize for modules
which use such a colorset may be a good idea\.
.PP
\fIShape\fR,
\fITiledShape\fR and
\fIAspectShape\fR
take a file name as an argument, search the
\fBImagePath\fR
and use it as the shape bitmap\.
\fITiledShape\fR
produces repeated copies of the bitmap with no scaling,
\fIShape\fR
causes the bitmap to be stretched to fit whatever object the
colorset is applied to and
\fIAspectShape\fR
stretches to fit but retains the bitmap aspect ratio\.  If the file
is a pixmap in xpm format the shape mask (all opaque pixels) of the
pixmap is used\.  For png and svg images, the shape mask is equivalent
to all not completely transparent pixels (alpha > 0)\.

\fBWarning\fR
Due to the way X11 implements shapes you cannot take back
making windows shaped\. You may have to restart fvwm or the shaped
application\.
.PP
\fI?Gradient \.\.\.\fR
creates a pixmap and stretches it to fit the window\.
\fI?Gradient\fR
may be one of \fIHGradient\fR, \fIVGradient\fR,
\fIDGradient\fR, \fIBGradient\fR,
\fISGradient\fR, \fICGradient\fR,
\fIRGradient\fR or \fIYGradient\fR\.
The gradient types
are as follows: H is horizontal; V is vertical; D is diagonal
from top left to bottom right; B is a backwards diagonal from
bottom left to top right; S is concentric squares; C is concentric
circles; R is a radar like pattern and Y is a Yin Yang style (but
without the dots)\.
Please refer to the
\fBColor Gradients\fR
section for the syntax of gradients\.
.PP
\fITint\fR
takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100\.  It
causes the image defined using
\fI?Pixmap\fR
or
\fI?Gradient\fR
to be tinted with the specified color using the percentage\.  If the
image is transparent
\fITint\fR
tints only the image part\.  Unfortunately, a colorset background
specified using the
\fITransparent\fR
option can give strange results\.  See the
\fITransparent\fR
option for details\.  With no arguments this option removes the
tint\.
.PP
\fIfgTint\fR
takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100\.  It
causes the color defined using
\fIfg\fR
to be tinted with the specified color using the percentage\.  With
no arguments this option removes the tint\.
.PP
\fIbgTint\fR
takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100\.  It
causes the color defined using
\fIbg\fR
to be tinted with the specified color using the percentage\.  If the
\fIsh\fR
and
\fIhi\fR
colors are not specified, they are recomputed from the tinted bg
color\.  With no arguments this option removes the tint\.
.PP
\fIAlpha\fR
takes a percentage between 0 and 100 as an argument\.  It causes
fvwm to merge the image defined using
\fI?Pixmap\fR
or
\fI?Gradient\fR
with the
\fIbg\fR
color using the percentage\.  If the percentage is 0 the image is
hidden and if it is 100 the image is displayed as usual (no
merge)\.  The default is 100 and it is restored if no argument is
given\.
.PP
\fIfgAlpha\fR
takes a percentage between 0 and 100 as an argument\.  It causes
fvwm to merge the text and the colorset background using the
percentage\.  If the percentage is 0 the text is hidden and if it is
100 the text is displayed as usual (no merge)\.  This option has an
effect only with fonts loaded by Xft, see the
\fBFont Names and Font Loading\fR
section\.  The default is 100 and it is restored if no argument is
given\.
.PP
\fIDither\fR
causes fvwm to dither the image defined using
\fI?Pixmap\fR
or
\fI?Gradient\.\fR
This is useful only with displays with depth less than or equal to
16 (i\.e\., on displays which can only display less than 65537
colors at once)\.  The dithering effect lets you simulate having
more colors available that you actually have\.
\fINoDither\fR
causes fvwm to do not dither the images\.
\fIDither\fR
is the default if the depth is less than or equal to 8 (a screen
with 256 colors or less)\.  In depth 15 (32768 colors) and 16 (65536
colors), the default is
\fINoDither\fR,
however this effect can be useful with images which contain a lot
of close colors\.  For example a fine gradient looks more
smooth\.
.PP
\fIIconTint\fR
takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100\.  It
causes fvwm or a module to tint the "icons" which are rendered
into the colorset background with the specified color using a
percentage\.  Here "icons" means, fvwm Icons, fvwm menu icons,
MiniIcons which represent applications in various modules, images
loaded by modules (e\.g\., images specified by the
\fIIcon\fR
\fBFvwmButtons\fR
button option) \.\.\.etc\.  With no arguments this option removes the
icon tint\.
.PP
\fIIconAlpha\fR
takes a percentage between 0 and 100 as an argument\.  It causes
fvwm to merge the "icons" which are rendered into the colorset
background using this percentage\.  The default is 100 and it is
restored if no argument is given\.
.PP
\fINote\fR:
It is equivalent to use "Tint a_color rate" and "Alpha a" if a =
100 and the bg color is a_color\.  This equivalence does not hold
for IconAlpha and IconTint as the background can be an image or a
gradient (and not a uniform color background)\.
However, in some cases you can achieve (almost) the same effect by
using IconTint in the place of IconAlpha\.  This is preferable as,
in general, IconAlpha generates more redrawing than IconTint\.
.PP
\fINoShape\fR
removes the shape mask from the colorset while
\fIPlain\fR
removes the background pixmap or gradient\.

A color gradient is a background that changes its color gradually
from one hue to a different one\.  Color gradients can be used by
various commands and modules of fvwm\.  There are eight types of
gradients:
\fBHGradient\fR
is a horizontal gradient,
\fBVGradient\fR
is vertical,
\fBDGradient\fR
is diagonal from top left to bottom right,
\fBBGradient\fR
is backwards diagonal from bottom left to top right,
\fBSGradient\fR
is concentric squares,
\fBCGradient\fR
is concentric circles,
\fBRGradient\fR
is a radar like pattern and
\fBYGradient\fR
is a Yin Yang style (but without the dots)\.
.PP
The color gradient syntax has two forms:
.HP 1
\fB?Gradient\fR \fIcolors\fR \fIstart\-color\fR \fIend\-color\fR
.PP
This form specifies a linear gradient\.  The arguments denote the
total number of \fIcolors\fR
to allocate (between 2 and 1000), the initial color and the final
color\.
.PP
Example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBTitleStyle\fR VGradient 20 rgb:b8/ce/bc rgb:5b/85/d0
.fi
.RE
.HP 1
\fB?Gradient\fR \fIcolors\fR \fIsegments\fR \fIcolor\fR \fIlength\fR \fIcolor\fR [\fIlength\fR\ \fIcolor\fR] ...
.PP
The second form specifies a nonlinear gradient\.  The arguments are:
the total number of \fIcolors\fR
to allocate (between 2 and 1000), then the number of
\fIsegments\fR\.
For each segment, specify the starting \fIcolor\fR,
a relative \fIlength\fR,
then the ending color\.  Each subsequent segment begins with the
second color of the last segment\.  The lengths may be any
non\-negative integers\.  The length of one segment divided by the
sum of all segments lengths is the fraction of the colors that
are used for the segment\.
