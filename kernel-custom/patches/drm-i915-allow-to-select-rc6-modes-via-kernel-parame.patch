Subject: [PATCH 1/2] drm/i915: allow to select rc6 modes via kernel parameter

This allows to select which rc6 modes are to be used via kernel parameter,
via a bitmask parameter. E.g.:

- to enable rc6, i915_enable_rc6=1
- to enable rc6 and deep rc6, i915_enable_rc6=3
- to enable rc6 and deepest rc6, use i915_enable_rc6=5
- to enable rc6, deep and deepest rc6, use i915_enable_rc6=7

Please keep in mind that the deepest RC6 state really should NOT be used
by default, as it could potentially worsen the issues with deep RC6. So do
enable it only when you know what you are doing. However, having it around
could help solving possible future rc6-related issues and their debugging
on user machines.

Note that this changes behavior - previously, value of 1 would enable both
RC6 and deep RC6. Now it should only enable RC6 and deep/deepest RC6
stages must be enabled manually.

v2: address Chris Wilson comments and clean up the code.

+ * RC6 is a special power stage which allows the GPU to enter an very
+ * low-voltage mode when idle, using down to 0V while at this stage.  This
+ * stage is entered automatically when the GPU is idle when RC6 support is
+ * enabled, and as soon as new workload arises GPU wakes up automatically as well.
+ *
+ * There are different RC6 modes available in Intel GPU, which differentiate
+ * among each other with the latency required to enter and leave RC6 and
+ * voltage consumed by the GPU in different states.
+ *
+ * The combination of the following flags define which states GPU is allowed
+ * to enter, while RC6 is the normal RC6 state, RC6p is the deep RC6, and
+ * RC6pp is deepest RC6. Their support by hardware varies according to the
+ * GPU, BIOS, chipset and platform. RC6 is usually the safest one and the one
+ * which brings the most power savings; deeper states save more power, but
+ * require higher latency to switch to and wake up.
