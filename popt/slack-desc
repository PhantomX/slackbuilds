# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

popt: popt (Command line parsing library)
popt:
popt: Popt is a C library for parsing command line parameters.  Popt was
popt: heavily influenced by the getopt() and getopt_long() functions, but it
popt: improves on them by allowing more powerful argument expansion.  Popt
popt: can parse arbitrary argv[] style arrays and automatically set
popt: variables based on command line arguments.  Popt allows command line
popt: arguments to be aliased via configuration files and includes utility
popt: functions for parsing arbitrary strings into argv[] arrays using
popt: shell-like rules.
