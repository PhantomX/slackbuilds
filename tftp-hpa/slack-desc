tftp-hpa: tftp-hpa (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
tftp-hpa:
tftp-hpa: The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is normally used only for
tftp-hpa: booting diskless workstations (or the Slackware installer). The tftp
tftp-hpa: package provides the user interface for TFTP, which allows users to
tftp-hpa: transfer files to and from a remote machine. This program and TFTP
tftp-hpa: provide very little security, and should not be enabled unless it is
tftp-hpa: expressly needed.
tftp-hpa: tftp-hpa is maintained by H. Peter Anvin.
