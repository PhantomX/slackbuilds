# It's not recommended to modify this file in-place, because it will be
# overwritten during package upgrades.  If you want to customize, the
# best way is to create a file "/etc/systemd/system/postgresql.service",
# containing
#	.include /lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service
#	...make your changes here...
# For more info about custom unit files, see

# For example, if you want to change the server's port number to 5433,
# create a file named "/etc/systemd/system/postgresql.service" containing:
#	.include /lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service
#	[Service]
#	Environment=PGPORT=5433
# This will override the setting appearing below.

# Note: do not use a PGDATA pathname containing spaces, or you will
# break postgresql-setup.
