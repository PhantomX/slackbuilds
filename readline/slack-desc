# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

readline: The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by
readline: applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed
readline: in.  Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available.  The Readline
readline: library includes additional functions to maintain a list of previously
readline: entered command lines, to recall and perhaps edit those lines, and
readline: perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.
