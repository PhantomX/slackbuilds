Subject: [PATCH] ntp: Make periodic RTC update more reliable

The current code requires that the scheduled update of the RTC happens
in the closest tick to the half of the second. This seems to be
difficult to achieve reliably. The scheduled work may be missing the
target time by a tick or two and be constantly rescheduled every second.

Relax the limit to 10 ticks. As a typical RTC drifts in the 11-minute
update interval by several milliseconds, this shouldn't affect the
overall accuracy of the RTC much.
