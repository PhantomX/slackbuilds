Comment from Sergio Durigan Junior:

  In order to correctly test this patch, I wrote a testcase based on Jan
  Kratochvil's <gdb/testsuite/gdb.base/gcore-excessive-memory.exp>.  The
  testcase, which can be seen below, tests GDB in order to see if the
  amount of memory being leaked is minimal, as requested in the bugzilla.
  It is hard to define what "minimum" is, so I ran the testcase on all
  supported RHEL architectures and came up with an average.

    	* python/py-inferior.c (infpy_read_memory): Remove cleanups and
    	explicitly free 'buffer' on exit paths.  Decref 'membuf_object'
    	before returning.
