Subject: [PATCH] CPU hotplug, cpusets, suspend: Don't modify cpusets during
 suspend/resume

In the event of CPU hotplug, the kernel modifies the cpusets' cpus_allowed
masks as and when necessary to ensure that the tasks belonging to the cpusets
have some place (online CPUs) to run on. And regular CPU hotplug is
destructive in the sense that the kernel doesn't remember the original cpuset
configurations set by the user, across hotplug operations.

However, suspend/resume (which uses CPU hotplug) is a special case in which
the kernel has the responsibility to restore the system (during resume), to
exactly the same state it was in before suspend.

In order to achieve that, do the following:

1. Don't modify cpusets during suspend/resume. At all.
   In particular, don't move the tasks from one cpuset to another, and
   don't modify any cpuset's cpus_allowed mask. So, simply ignore cpusets
   during the CPU hotplug operations that are carried out in the
   suspend/resume path.

2. However, cpusets and sched domains are related. We just want to avoid
   altering cpusets alone. So, to keep the sched domains updated, build
   a single sched domain (containing all active cpus) during each of the
   CPU hotplug operations carried out in s/r path, effectively ignoring
   the cpusets' cpus_allowed masks.

   (Since userspace is frozen while doing all this, it will go unnoticed.)

3. During the last CPU online operation during resume, build the sched
   domains by looking up the (unaltered) cpusets' cpus_allowed masks.
   That will bring back the system to the same original state as it was in
   before suspend.

Ultimately, this will not only solve the cpuset problem related to suspend
resume (ie., restores the cpusets to exactly what it was before suspend, by
not touching it at all) but also speeds up suspend/resume because we avoid
running cpuset update code for every CPU being offlined/onlined.
