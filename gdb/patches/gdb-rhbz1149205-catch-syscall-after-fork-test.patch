  Subject: RFA: fix gdb_assert caused by 'catch signal ...' and fork
  Date: Thu, 09 May 2013 23:56:22 +0200

  The attached patch fixes a gdb_assert caused by the combination of catch
  signal and fork:
    break-catch-sig.c:152: internal-error: signal_catchpoint_remove_location: Assertion `signal_catch_counts[iter] > 0' failed.

  The problem is that the signal_catch_counts is decremented by detach_breakpoints.
  The fix consists in not detaching breakpoint locations of type bp_loc_other.
  The patch introduces a new test.

Comments by Sergio Durigan Junior:

  I addded a specific testcase for this patch, which tests exactly the
  issue that the customer is facing.  This patch does not solve the
  whole problem of catching a syscall and forking (for more details,
  see <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13457>,
  specifically comment #3), but it solves the issue reported by the
  customer.

  I also removed the original testcase of this patch, because it
  relied on "catch signal", which is a command that is not implemented
  in this version of GDB.
