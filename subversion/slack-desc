# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

subversion: subversion (A version control system)
subversion:
subversion: Subversion is a version control system which allows you to keep old
subversion: versions of files and directories (usually source code), and keep a
subversion: log of who, when, and why changes occurred, similar to other such
subversion: systems like CVS, RCS or SCCS.  Subversion keeps all the information
subversion: to permit extracting previous versions of those files at any time.
