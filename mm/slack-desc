mm: mm (Shared Memory Allocation library)
mm:
mm: OSSP mm is a 2-layer abstraction library which simplifies the usage of
mm: shared memory between forked processes.  On the first layer it hides
mm: all platform dependent implementation details (allocation and locking)
mm: when dealing with shared memory segments and on the second layer it
mm: provides a high-level malloc(3)-style API to work with data inside
mm: those shared memory segments.  Apache, PHP, and other projects use mm.
mm: The mm library was written by Ralf S. Engelschall.
