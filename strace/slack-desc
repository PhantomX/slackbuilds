# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

strace: strace (Trace system calls and signals)
strace:
strace: Strace allows you to trace the execution of a command.  It runs the
strace: specified command until it exits, intercepting signals and system
strace: calls and dumping the information to the standard error.  System
strace: administrators, diagnosticians and trouble-shooters will find it
strace: invaluable for solving problems with programs for which the source
strace: is not readily available since they do not need to be recompiled in
strace: order to trace them.
