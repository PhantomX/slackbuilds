# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libxml2-compat32: libxml2-compat32 (XML parser library)
libxml2-compat32:
libxml2-compat32: Libxml2 is the XML C parser library and toolkit.  XML itself is a
libxml2-compat32: metalanguage to design markup languages  -- i.e. a text language where
libxml2-compat32: structures are added to the content using extra "markup" information
libxml2-compat32: enclosed between angle brackets.  HTML is the most well-known markup
libxml2-compat32: language.  Though the library is written in C, a variety of language
libxml2-compat32: bindings make it available in other environments.
