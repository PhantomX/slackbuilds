Subject: [PATCH] char: Disable write callback if throttled chardev is detached

If a throttled chardev is detached from the frontend device, all future
callbacks should be suppressed.  Not doing this results in a segfault.

Bugzilla: 745758
Upstream: Not applicable, since throttling is a RHEL6-only feature.
