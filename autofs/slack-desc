# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

autofs: autofs (Kernel-based automounter)
autofs:
autofs: autofs is a kernel-based automounter for Linux.  It performs a job
autofs: similar to amd(8) but relies on a small stub of kernel code instead of
autofs: pretending to be an NFS server.  The result is simpler code, better
autofs: reliability, and much faster operation in the common case (everything
autofs: already mounted.)
